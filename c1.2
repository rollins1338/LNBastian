“If you don’t care about your wife and child, you’re free to go. But if not, ask me for mercy.” Sandrine tossed the tie away and finished unbuttoning his shirt, exposing his naked, well trimmed chest. “You know what I want, you used it as bait to lure me in and now I want it.”

   “Am I that expensive or is it that you are just that cheap?” Bastian said, his mouth curling into a sneer.

   Sandrine didn’t answer him, she knew he was just trying to bait her again, and instead of answering, she closed the distance between and kissed him.

Soon, their heavy, ragged breaths disrupted the tranquil atmosphere of the room.

Chapter 137.


Companion in The Ruin.



“Thank you so much, Dora,” Odette said.

   Margrethe bound into the room and immediately threw herself at Odette, her tail whipping side to side frantically and her tongue lapping at Odette’s face.

   “You have one hour,” Dora said, who was looking nervous at disobeying the master of the house and letting Odette see her dog. She thought her master did this because of a moment of anger, however, it had been ongoing for a span of 15 days.

   Bastian confiscated Margrethe and gave her to Dora to look after, with stern orders that Odette was forbidden to see the dog. Dora only obeyed and took the villain role because she had been commanded, but it was difficult as the dog constantly whined like a child who had lost their mother.

“Do you like Meg that much?”   Seeing the two reunited made Dora sigh, the two were really so very fond of each other and she couldn’t help but laugh as they played. It was enough to erase the guilt Dora felt for disobeying her master. “I'd let you spend an hour with Meg every day. However, I hope that you will keep it a secret from master.”

“Of course. I will make sure you stay out of trouble, Dora.”

   The two made their promises to each other as Odette arranged the ribbons in Margrethe’s hair. Odette gave Margrethe a kiss on the top of her nose and hugged her tight. Odette looked so different compared to the last couple weeks, she seemed genuinely happy.

   Why is the master so ruthless that he would refuse to let his wife even see a dog that makes her happy?

   Dora let out a reserved sigh. If Odette was to treat her husband as she did Margrethe, she could enjoy all the gold and finery she could ever ask for. Dora felt frustrated by Odette, who was foolish enough to not see how easy her life could be.

   “Would you like to go for a week? Of course you do, you must come with me,” Dora said, looking out over the sun filled garden.

Odette's face lit up with a joyful grin, her eyes resembling those of a surprised rabbit.

In the end, Dora chose to disobey her master's orders twice. This was her punishment for the time she had spent caring for Odette so closely.



The claw marks disappeared under the shirt as the buttons were done up one by one. Bastian was careful not to agitate where Sandrine had scratched at his chest.

   Piece by piece, he picked up his clothes on the floor and put them on, ensuring they were straight and presentable. Lastly, after putting on a tie, he took his handkerchief and wiped away the lipstick from his cheek and tossed it into the fire. He looked almost as if he had just walked into the room.

   “You’re crazy,” Sandrine said, rousing from the sofa. Her wild red hair made her seem insane.

   Bastian barely glimpsed at Sandrine, as he recovered the crumpled piece of paper with the crude drawing of his wife on it. It followed quickly after the handkerchief and Bastian didn’t move until he was satisfied it was nothing but ash.

   “I believe our transaction complete, all debts settled, Lady Laviere,” Bastian said, giving Sandrine a cold glare. “I won’t be interfering with any of the other paintings you have in your possession. Whether you choose to put them in another exhibit or hand them over to the papers. Just be warned, if you do, my response will not be the same as just now. The next we meet, you will be asking me for mercy.”

    “Oh, making threats now, are we?” Sandrine smirked, the smeared lipstick completed the look of someone who had lost their mind.

Bastian shook his head lightly and put on his gloves. “I am giving you advice, in consideration to our past relationship.  If you cooperate, there's no need for me to trouble myself with giving you lessons.”

   “You really think it will go your way just because I step down?” Sandrine got up from the sofa and trembly walked through the room, the look of triumph on her face. “The woman you try to protect by doing this crazy things with me hates you. Just as you despise me for wanting to have you by doing this. Its so funny that you’re getting back what you did to me, what you promised. If I had known it would be like this, I would have taken it easy on Odette. I’ve never seen someone so eager to repay their disgrace.” she glared at Bastian with both fear and joy in her eyes.

   Bastian didn’t say a word and continued to glare at Sandrine with his cold blue eyes, calmly putting on his gloves. Sandrine bit her lip so hard, she drew blood and the pain of it caused tears to come to her eyes.

   “I think I know why Odette ran away from you, she must really recognise the monster you really are.”

   Bastian remained unmoved by Sandrine’s hateful words. His face, devoid of emotions, was like a statue.

   Sandrine felt a wash of embarrassment come over her, at once she felt pathetic and stepped away from Bastian. Why was she so eager to try and please this monster? To think, she had let herself fall victim to this lunatic, even after what she went through with her ex-husband. Without meaning to, she felt grateful dan sorry for Odette, who had taken her place.  

“I will speak with your father and iron out the details for resolving the contract between us, until then, good day, Lady Laviere.” Bastian nodded in satisfaction, turned and left. He acted so gracefully, as if their 'scuffle' on the sofa some time ago had never happened.  “Well, lets hope there are no more unfortunate events to force us to meet again.”

Sandrine tried her best to remain strong, but the second Bastian left the room, she collapsed to the floor and wept.

   She was so angry with herself and felt utterly humiliated. She had to resign herself in the knowledge that, one day, Bastian would be forced to feel this way too. Perhaps it had already happened

"Remember this day, Bastian!” Sandrine's cries of animosity echoed through the late afternoon sunlight. “Your love will eventually meet a similar fate, much like mine has!”

Bastian paused briefly, then resumed walking without looking back. As he moved away, Sandrine's cries grew louder, blending with the fading rhythm of his footsteps.

The love that she had so yearned for, slipped through her fingers like sand. It was a pitiful ending, fit for the worst, third rate operas.



Franz woke in the face of the blinding afternoon sun. He had drunk himself stupid the night before and could barely recall what had happened. He awoke, lying on his back in his bed, maybe his mother had been there.

   Franz very slowly stood up, holding his throbbing head together. He remembered he had trashed the room, thrown bottles, tossed furniture, but it was all cleaned up now.

   Even though he had fallen so far that everyone pointed and laughed at his failure, his mother still stood by his side, it made him sick. He would rather endure his fathers wrath. The hell that would drive him mad would be his mothers morbid obsession with making him better than Bastian.

   He staggered toward the bathroom. Standing in front of the sink, Franz looked at the wreck of a man in the mirror. The cuts across his face were all the more better because of his mothers treatment, but the bruises were still broad and ugly.

   After gingerly washing his face, Franz went back to the room and immediately started again on a bottle of whiskey, but found the bottle to be empty. He tossed the bottle out of the window and immediately saw Bastian’s mansion, he started to think about Odette again.

   He staggered out onto the balcony as if possessed. The calm sea glittered under the winter sun and Franz couldn’t help but think of them like Odette’s sparkling eyes when she smiled. Anger welled up inside.

   He wanted to have her on canvas. The stolen oil painting was one of his most cherished works and sometimes, when he was lonely, having that painting around was better than having the real Odette for company.

   Odette, the woman he so loved with all his heart, was mercilessly trampled by a monster.

   When the painting was burned, Franz felt like he had lost a piece of himself and everything after that felt like it was happening to someone else. The farewell to Ella was a relief, he laughed for a long time when he lost all his money in the railway deal and even as his father beat him, he felt nothing. All because of Bastian’s ruse.

   Being the heir to this family was a death sentence. A fact that drove his father mad, but for Franz, he felt like the door of his cage he had been stuck in for so long had burst open. Now that he was free, he wanted to fall ever deeper into the abyss, deep down where his mothers vain hopes could not reach him.

   When he thought of Odette, who was no doubt going through her own hell right now, he wanted to be with her in their ruin. Maybe now she would understand that they were meant for each other.

Odette. my Odette.


As he repeated her name, Franz began to see a flash of life in his eyes. He learned that Odette was confined, carrying Bastian's child. The thought of Odette enduring worse days than his brought a strange sense of satisfaction, as if she might finally realize he was the only one for her and can help her.


Franz flushed as he drew Odette in his mind, Odette who no longer rejected him, who was filled with love and passion in her jewel like eyes, the Odette from his lost painting.


Franz returned to his room. He gathered together all the money and jewellery he could get his hands on. He needed to let go of the sense of debt owed to his mother, it wasn’t his fault he wasn’t born as Bastian Klauswitz.

   The hour chimed when Franz left the bedroom and made his way down the quiet hallway. The house was as still as a dead rat. After everything that happened, his father couldn’t be around his family and ran off to one of his lovers in the capital. His mother was bed ridden from the shock of finding out that her husband had other lovers. What a dignified and noble family.

   Franz went by his fathers study to retrieve the car keys. He found more money and some other sparkling trinkets worth a little bit. Just as he was about to turn and leave, he saw the gun hanging on the wall. There was no doubt Bastian would try and interfere.

Leaving the mansion through the back door, Franz ran straight to the garage. Soon after, a black car started speeding toward the forest that linked the two mansion.

Chapter 138.


A Lost Heart.

A stray cat appeared in the garden and Margrethe went on a rampage, but despite her minor frame, Odette maintained a tight grip on the leash.

   “No Meg, you can’t go chasing cats.” 

   Margrethe obediently understood and stayed by Odette’s side. Only then did Odette substitute her stern look for a smile. She didn’t forget to give Margrethe a scratch behind the ears and compliment her.

   Odette walked slowly down the path between the house and the flower beds. The sound of Dora’s footsteps just behind them was ever present.

   “Dora,” a voice called as Odette reached the bottom of the path. A young maid ran across the garden.

   “Go, Dora, I will only be here with Meg,” Odette said, pointing to a bench under the pergola. “Don’t worry, you know I can’t run away looking like this.”

   “But madam, I know you, you can fly away if you were just in a shift, with Margrethe.”

   “Not if I don’t have enough money I can’t.” A weak smile spread across Odette’s face. “As you can see, I have lost my wings.”

   The head maid looked at Odette and then smiled herself. “I don’t suppose you would tell me if I asked why it had to be like that?”

   “I’m sorry, Dora.”

   Odette drew the line in a gentle manner, took Margrethe in her arms and approached the bench under the pergola. The head maid watched her for a moment, then turned away to tend to her duties.

   A wry smile played across Odette’s lips as she recalled the concern Dora had raised. Ever since the incident with Count Xanders, the security at the mansion had more than doubled. Even if she was able to get away from the watchmen’s eyes, she would have to get past the gatekeeper's. There was no way to leave the mansion without jumping into the sea.

   Odette earnestly hoped that Count Xanders understood her words when she called for help. It might be impossible to escape, but hopefully Countess Trier might be able to help her, she was the only one.

   But what if the Countess turned her back too?

   Odette’s mood deepened as she stared out toward the western skies and the setting sun. That was when Margrethe’s mood changed without warning.

   The feral cat had been hiding among the flower beds and decided to make its presence known again. Margrethe immediately went on a rampage, jumping from the bench in excitement. Odette tried to call her back, but she was not listening this time and chased the cat into the forest on the other side of the trail.

   Odette chased after Meg. The forest was her playground, but if Odette should come across a wild animal, it could quickly dissolve into a dangerous situation.

   “Meg,” Odette called out. She could still hear Margrethe barking and followed the noise.

   As Odette ran breathlessly through the forest, calling after Meg, she finally showed up with a pine cone in her mouth. Margrethe had completely forgotten about the stray cat and came back with a new toy in her mouth. Odette laughed as Meg dropped the cone at Odette’s feet.

   “Silly Meg, not that, come, lets go back and get your ball.” Odette picked up Margrethe and turned to head back to the mansion. She froze as she heard footsteps.

   “Odette?”

Odette turned around and widened her eyes. A man suddenly appeared on a byway narrow enough for one person to pass,  “Franz?”

   The blood drained from Odette’s face as she recognised the scruffy looking man, stumbling through the woods toward her. Margrethe started growling, slightly showing teeth.

   “Is that really you?”

   Franz burst into laughter. He looked like a mad man, with his dishevelled clothes and messy hair and bruised face. He looked completely different to when she had last seen him. As he came closer, Odette could smell alcohol.

   “Look at this, I knew it was going to be like this,” Franz muttered incoherently and his gloomy eyes lit up.

   Sensing that something wasn’t right, Odette stepped away from Franz, clutching Margrethe tightly. There was no way Franz was in his right mind, looking as he did and after everything that had happened.

   Odette turned and ran as fast as she could. She cried for help, sounding like a banshee as she wailed. As she ran, a cold hand grabbed her arm and another covered her mouth to silence her screaming.

   The drunken Franz led Odette into the woods, Margrethe, having been dropped to the floor yapped at their heels. She calmed down and stopped hounding them when Franz gave her a swift kick to the side.

   “Madam? Where are you? Madam!” servants were calling from the mansion.

   Franz dragged Odette deeper into the woods, to a narrow road that Odette seldom came to. By the time they reached it, she had stopped all meaningless resistance.

   “Be patient with me, Odette,” Franz whispered. He quickly pulled out his pocket knife and put it on Odette's neck and accidentally scratched her neck. He looked horrified at the sight of blood on her pale skin.“I don’t want to hurt you, do you understand?”

After hearing his words, Odette stopped struggling. Her pale face looked so beautiful. Her untidy look and pregnant belly, carrying the child of the low creature, couldn't mar her beauty.

“I love you, Odette,” Franz smiled and quickened his pace. “I have come to rescue you.”



The cream coloured car sped along the coastal road, the sea burnt orange by the setting sun on one side and high class mansions on the other.

   Bastian shifted gears as he swung the car around the bends, following the weave of the Ardenne sea. His mind was on his fathers downfall, even as he moved about, shaking hands with all that would dare touch him. At this rate, his fathers self-destruction was inevitable. He wished it would be concluded before the spring.

   If all was completed in time, the baby would be born by the summer and he will finally have a child with royal blood. Although plans for remarriage were out the window, it didn’t really matter, he wasn’t interested in the marriage game any more and if the child needed a mother, it wouldn’t be too hard to find a suitable candidate.

 Bastian took out a cigarette as he coasted along. He took a long drag and drew it out like a sigh, filing the evening air with thick smoke.

No matter how much he smoked, the deep chill in his chest never faded or went away. He stared out into the twilight of the horizon as a purple twilight began to fall

   The memories of Sandrine’s thin body still haunted his mind, and the fear laden eyes remained as vivid as ever. Sandrine had pounced like a beast in heat. He remembered the scene with a calm expression on his face.

He smirked when her shirtless hand touched his belt. The way Sandrine acted was like having a mirror brought up in front of him. Was this how it was with Odette, was this how he made her feel? The more he thought about it, the more disgusted he was with Sandrine.

   Bastian distanced himself from the whole thing and didn’t register what was going on until Sandrine cried out into the empty mansion. He found himself straddling her, who had been tossed onto the sofa, grabbing her by the neck. It was an instinct reaction.

   It was only a way to subdue her, who was out of control. He did not want to hurt her in the slightest, but he knew he could have easily strangled her neck. It was a cold and murderous intent he had never felt before, not even on the battlefield. Sandrine noticed it too, the sudden change in her eye told him so.

 When he felt the urge to kill for the first time in his life, it wasn’t Sandrine’s face he saw, but his own. It was the monster reflected in Odette’s eyes.

   Had he been successful in his quest for revenge? He asked himself that question a number of times, but could not find the answer.

  For the briefest moment, Bastian came back to reality as he flicked his cigarette out of the window. At that exact moment, a car came from the opposite direction, a black car. It could easily have been a trick of the failing light, but he could have sworn he saw Franz driving his father’s car and…

   “Odette?”

   Bastian’s mind became suddenly clear when he saw other passengers in the back seat. Without a single shred of doubt left, he knew it was her.

   Franz was driving at a dangerous pace and Bastian was almost sure that Odette had been banging on the window, calling out for help.

   Squealing tires broke the calm of the night and the sound of an engine being pushed to its limits.

Chapter 139.


Wrong Calculation.


Bastian’s car passed by without so much as a hesitation in its speeding progression. Odette let her hand fall from banging on the window as she was left bereft of hope.

   Odette couldn’t believe her luck when it was Bastin’s car she saw coming toward them just as she was desperately trying to free her hands from the bindings. He was her last hope, but she could not reach out to him, like always.

   “We should go abroad, to some a place where no one knows who we are,” Franz said, he had barely stopped talking and acted like they could have a rosy future together.

   A wash of fear spread through Odette as she watched Franz, his chattering was frantic and his eyes stared out in mania. Then something caught her eye, a glint of metal on the back seat, strewn amongst the hastily packed luggage, it was a gun.

   She watched Franz closely, he didn’t seem to have picked up on the fact that she had noticed the gun, he was too busy talking frantically about the impossible future.

   Odette cautiously squirmed her way closer to the gun. If she wanted to get out of this mess, she was going to have to do it herself, as always. She was always alone, so it was futile to think that anyone would come and rescue her.

   “I will announce the child in your belly as my own. It wasn’t your fault that you were so mercilessly thrown to the wolves, but it will be okay now, I understand.”

   Franz’s delusions now spilled over into the realms of creating a happy family, as if they could be anything but dysfunctional, when you kidnap your half-brothers wife.

   Odette did her best to keep trying for the gun, afraid of Franz’s madness. It did not help that he was drunk and could barely keep control of the car. She had to stop him before they had a terrible accident.

   “You will learn to love me, Odette,” Franz said, laughing.

   As laughed, Odette shoved away a bag that was blocking her path to the gun and made a grab for it. Bastian had taught her how to shoot and the memories she thought were long forgotten, came back in a rush of vivid sensations.

'Keep an eye on it.'


  She could feel Bastian at her back, positioning her, showing her the correct manner in which to hold a gun. She remembered the heat of his breath on the nape of her neck, the warmth of the golden sun, and he wind blowing between the sky and the sea.

   Odette followed Bastian’s instructions, taking deep breaths to calm her mind, but it was difficult to steady her hand. She made sure that the sights lined up properly as she aimed for the drivers seat. Her breathing was something Bastian had corrected several times.

   “Stop the car right now,” Odette yelled. Only then did Franz snap back to reality.

   “You’re not upset about what happened earlier, are you?” He looked at Odette in the rear view mirror and chuckled. “You know I only did that to save you, right?”

   “Stop making excuses and stop the car.” Odette brought the aim of the gun up to Franz’s head, so that he could fully see. “You are just a disgusting man, with criminal desires. You have insulted me with your dirty mind and even kidnapped me.” Odette moved her finger to the trigger.

Bastian will come, she was sure about it. Now he should've arrived at the mansion and learned she was missing. If he saw injured Margrethe, he'd grasp the situation. He'd do anything for his child and come to their rescue. She only needed to stop the car to buy time.

   “You better think about what you’re doing, Odette, you only have me now and once I’m gone, there’s going to be no one to save you.” Even as he spoke, the car started to slow down. Even in the face of being blind drunk, Franz seemed to understand the futility of the situation and did not want to loose his life.

   “This is my final warning, stop the car and let me go, or I will shoot you.”

   It was then that a distant flash of light alerted Odette to a car coming along the coastal road behind them. A beam of light that was rapidly closing the distance.

   Franz noticed it too and started to speed up again. The glimpse of hesitation in Odette’s eyes quickly vanished and she had made up her mind and she knew she could not waste her last chance.

   Bastian’s instructional voice rang in her head.

   Look ahead, raise your head, correct your posture and don’t close your eyes.

Even a distant fear, she remained focused on her target, just as Bastian's lasting advice echoed within her.

Recalling that day, Odette fired the gun.



Just as Bastian caught up with the tail lights of the car ahead, there was a sudden flash of light and a very distinct note of thunder. A gunshot. The car ahead swerved off the road, bouncing off the guard rail and flinging to the other side of the road, where it came to a stop after crashing into a tree.

   Bastian breathed heavily as he pulled up next to the crashed car. His mind was blank but his emotions were all over the place.

Please.  God..please…

Bastian prayed as he got out of the car, not entirely sure what it was he was going to see, he could only hope that at least Odette remained safe.

   The damage was not severe, the car had not been going too fast, but he had heard the unmistakable sound of a gunshot. Bastian ran to the car and just as he crossed the road, the back door swung open and a woman stumbled out.

   A relived sigh escaped Bastian’s lips as he recognised the dark hair of the woman fluttering in the sea breeze. Before he could reach her, the drivers door opened and Franz struggled out, clutching at his bleeding arm.

   Odette reacted immediately. “Stand still, don’t come any closer,” she shouted, holding the gun out in front of her.

   Franz froze on the spot, holding up the hand of his injured arm, while the other hand groped at his injured arm. He let out a panicked cry when he saw Bastian as well.

She was safe. Bastian wiped his stiff face with trembling hands

   Before either of the men could do or say anything, there was a deafening bang as another gunshot rang out into the still night air. Odette had fired a warning shot into the air, then aimed at Franz again.

   Bastian cautiously approached Odette, like he was trying to get near a really pissed off mother bear. Odette was terrified and she had a gun, anything could happen so it was important to get control of the situation.

   “Odette?” Bastian said in a calm, soothing voice.

   She turned her head to look at him. Her face was drenched in tears, her eyes were blood shot and her cheeks were puffy, but she recognised  the man standing behind her in the blurry silhouette.

He came.


Seeing him, Odette went limp, and Bastian swiftly disarmed her, tossing the gun aside.   “Well done, its okay now,” Bastian whispered as he embraced Odette. 

She collapsed into his arms like a sand castle crumbling before the encroaching tide. They were illuminated in the headlights of another car that was approaching them. Odette swallowed her tears and took control of her breathing, entrusting herself into his embrace To her surprise, Dora got out.


"Oh my god! Madam!" Dora rushed to Odette's side. The armed attendants followed in a line behind her.


  “Take my wife back to the mansion,” Bastian said.

Once Odette was safely away, Bastian turned to Franz, who was smirking like he had lost his mind. Blood and tears covered his contorted face.


The royal heir his father longed for had descended into an irreparable abyss. Bastian's eyes mirrored the dark depths of a winter sea as he witnessed a scene unfold before him.


Using Odette to ruin Franz was part of his plan. That's why all this time he stayed quiet about Franz's crazy desires, turning them into a divorce ground by accusing her of an affair with her husband's half-brother. It's absurd for him to blame Sandrine and Franz now. He should credit them, because they helped him to reach his goal instead. 

   “Asshole,” Franz spat,  breaking the wall of silence that lay between them. “She betrayed you and yet you come riding in like some noble knight in shinning armour. Do you even love her?”

   Bastian stayed silent.

   “You think you’ve won, don’t you? That you’ve taken everything from her, but you’re welcome Bastian. You’re just like me in the end, no matter what you do, you will never have her. No. You’re an even bigger loser than I am because you made her your wife, fathered a child, but you couldn't win her heart."

   Bastian still said nothing and simply turned away from Franz. The attendants who had exited their cars were gathering around them.

It's wrong calculation. He admitted his failings, as he strode calmly to Odette’s car. Franz continued to shout and rant, but Bastian tuned it out. He was focused on one thing and one thing only, the woman who had been the start of all this mess.


  If he couldn’t love, then he would hate and he would see its end there, but now he could see and was beginning to understand. Hate was just the shadow of love and in the end, 

….He loved her.

From once basking in brilliant light to now being under the shadow it casts.

   As he came to realise this hollow truth, Bastian felt pain in his shoulder. He turned to see Franz standing before him, a bloody knife in his hand...

...it's his blood..

“BASTIAN!”


Just as Odette let out a scream, a more forceful blow's sound  rang out.

Chapter 140.


The Only Beautiful Thing.
Franz didn’t know when the knife had been taken from him, but when he realised it was no longer in his hand, it was already too late. He was sprawled out on his back, Bastian leaning over him with the knife in his hand. It had happened in the blink of an eye.

   Franz let out a hysterical laugh, even as the pain in his back burned. He knew he wouldn’t be able to beat Bastian, but if he could take him by surprise then maybe. It had not worked, clearly. 

   “How the true nature of the lowly beast come forth,” Franz said, trying to provoke Bastian as he lay facing the night sky. Even after the stabbing, he didn't budge an inch. 

He realized he couldn't ever defeat this monstrous foe when Odette’ shot shattered the car’s window. That Franz Klauswitz's life had ended, a reality he had long accepted. He would forever dwell in his half-brother's shadow, perhaps even since the day he was born and couldn't become another Bastian Klauswitz.

   “Do you want to know why I was contented to just watch you?” Bastian said, “you were nothing more than an accessory for your mother. There was no reason to treat you as your own agent, but now you bare your teeth to me, out of greed that has nothing to do with your mother. This is a different story.” Bastian stared down at Franz.

   Franz swallowed dryly. Bastian had never taken him seriously, not even for a second. But now he was taking him seriously and the horror of the realisation washed over him and fear gripped his heart.

   He was sick and tired of living a life that felt more like a never ending death sentence, always living in another persons shadow, always expected to achieve and out do his counter part. He was done with it, he wanted to die and didn’t care that Bastian would be the executioner.

Somehow, he was no longer afraid of Bastian. While he might not be able to reach where he was in the end, he had the power to bring him down to his own level on the ground. It was the first time in his life that Franz felt like his equal.

   “Do you really love her?” Franz said as he giggled, out of breath and clapping his hands. “Do you have some longing for terrible traitors that don’t love you back? That's what your dog did, right?

Franz recalled Bastian's hidden care for a stray dog.  One day, while fleeing from a riding lesson he despised, he found a large, wolf-like wild dog in the forest and he saw his half-brother, Bastian, feeding the animal.

Once it had finished its meal, the dog sauntered over to the base of the tree where Bastian sat who was looking up at the sky.

Franz couldn't tear his gaze away from that peaceful scene.  

The dog released a long yawn and nestled into Bastian's lap, receiving gentle strokes on its head. A gentle breeze rustled the blossoming forest, and the spring sun filtered through the leaves, casting a warm glow on Bastian's smiling face. It was the first time Franz had ever seen his brother look like an ordinary, happy boy.

Consumed by curiosity, Franz hurried home to his mother and shared what he had witnessed. A few days later, the wild dog met a tragic end; ‘that the dog had become aggressive after being accidentally shot with an anesthetic bullet during a hunting lesson, and it had bitten Bastian.’ Cornered, Bastian was forced to use his own hands to end the dog's life. And after that the family's future took a different path. Bastian left home and became the grandson of a junk dealer.

'"You love the dog that bit you because it was blinded by a piece of meat. Now you love the woman who stabbed you in the back to protect her sister. What a tearful love."  Franz smiled like his mother the day he learned Bastian's secret.  “So now you just have to kill her, right?”

   Franz could see in the minute cracks in Bastian’s stern expression that he was getting to him, he was dealing Bastian a blow that struck harder than any physical punch he could muster.

   “That’s your way of loving, isn’t it?”

   That was it, the final chip at Bastian’s cool resolve. Franz didn’t even see it coming, all he felt was pain and the world rushing around in a blur of unfocused lights and colour. 

His face smeared with blood from his nose and lips.

Oh how it hurt, but he laughed all the same, he had finally won against Bastian.



Something was wrong. Odette could feel it in the moment when her eyes met Franz, who was smirking through the blood and bruises. Even in that moment, when Bastian was beating the life out of him, he looked happy, like he wanted this end from the moment he kidnapped her.

   “No, its too dangerous, madam,” Dora said, who stopped Odette in her tracks. “Please, just get in the car so we can get out of here. You must think about your baby!”

   Odette knew that Dora was right, but she couldn’t so easily turn away. The servants were struggling to pull Bastian off Franz, who easily got free of their feeble hands to strike out at Franz one more time. Cold and calm, like a surgeon performing an operation, he mercilessly continued to beat him.

 At this rate, Franz was going to die at the hands of his half-brother. Bastian was so enamoured by rage that he could not see that the one that was cornered was himself.

   Odette broke free of Dora and ran with all urgency to Bastian Before she realised what she had done, she flung herself at him, hugging him from the back.

   “Please stop, Bastian,” Odette pleaded desperately.

   Bastian paused as he approached Franz, who had collapsed in the middle of the road. When he focused on the world around him, he looked at Odette.

   “Please stop, you are putting your own life at risk.”

   Odette’s arms around his waist slowly cooled the anger in his heart and reawakened his rationality. Despite being petrified with fear, Odette did not relent.

   “You have to protect our baby, so please, stop.”

   The baby. A laugh escaped with each ragged breath as he repeated  the excuse Odette had found. It reminded him of his own reflection in her eyes. A monster with a single minded desire to take revenge by stealing her child.

   He knew what Franz’s intentions were, but he had allowed himself to get caught up in base emotions any way. It was the same murderous intent he had faced when with Sandrine’s little trick as she presented Odette’s vulgar picture. 

   “Bastian…” Odette whispered his name, her melodic voice carrying across the wind.

   Bastian looked down at her, shutting out the rest of the world until there was only her. Weakness always became the target of attacks. Bastian knew that all too well, a tactic he had employed many times himself. What hurt the most was that it was a weakness he was completely unaware of.

Odette…

   His eyes sunk deep and became like an abyss as he looked at his weakness, a weakness exploited by Franz and Sandrine. That was when Theodora came onto the scene with the sound of screeching tires.

   “Franz? Oh my lord, Franz,” she yelled hysterically.

   Franz was sprawled out into the middle of the road like a corpse, the only sign of life was the wheezing breath escaping from between broken teeth. However, he shrugged off his mother's help, pushing her away.

   “Keep going, Bastian,” Franz coughed. “Finish me off, kill me, KILL ME!” he shouted.

   Franz struggled to pull himself up, screaming hysterically at Bastian, Theodora was desperately trying to calm her son, sat on the road and hugging Franz, but her efforts were reduced to simply crying.

   Bastian ignored it all as he concentrated solely on Odette. He saw her as clear as day, her big bright eyes filled with nothing but him. In her eyes he could see his fathers face, the one thing he hated more, the ugly monster that his father had created, who followed a life he hated so much.

   The curses poured from Theodora, coupled with Franz’s bloodied screams and the chatter of the servants. All the fuss filled the air with a buzz of annoyance and Bastian wanted nothing more than to make it stop.

   As the light started to fade in a blur of darkened vision, as he felt the trap closing around him again, his breathing became irregular. The world became a dream again and as he was about to lose control all over again, a small, warm hand rested on his cheek.

   “Bastian?” A voice came like the silver threads of moonlight.

   Bastian focused on the moonlight and the noise of the world around him faded into background noise. His life, marred by muddiness, in vain, and full of disappointment, occupied his thoughts. And then, in that very moment, he felt the tender touch against his face.

   “I’m fine now,” Odette said as he turned his attention to her. He was breathing like a chased beast, but gradually came back to stability thanks to her caress on his cheek.  “Lets go back together,” she smiled through tear-stained cheeks, a blend of both light and darkness in her face.

  Odette...

She was a weakness that would always come under attack from his enemies. The stray dog he had killed taught him a life lesson that would remain etched in his memory. He knew he had to let go of her, but even in that realisation, how could he? He could never let go of this woman, who shook him off with just her fingertips.

   His whole world, that had been meticulously built through concise calculations was falling apart quicker than he could rebuild.

   Bastian clung to the only beautiful thing he had left in the ruins of his life, but it was a hopeless salvation.

Chapter 141.
Order.


Today, Odette slept deeply as well. Bastian quietly closed the door and tiptoed across the room. The servant who had been guarding Odette’s bedroom quietly got up and moved away. After draping his coat over the back of the chair, Bastian took up the post the servant had just vacated.

   In the light of the nightstand lamp, Odette's face looked  more relaxed than it did this morning. She had fallen asleep by the time they returned to the mansion and Bastian had to carry Odette up to her bedroom. She roused briefly when the doctor came to check up on her, then she immediately fell back asleep.

   Fortunately, there was no physical trauma. There were a few cuts and scrapes from when the car collided with the tree, but other than that, the only problem was the feebleness of her body. The doctors claimed that the hurdle was clear, but it was better to be safe.

   Doctor Kramer likened Odette to a delicate china doll that had already been cracked. She can be shattered with the slightest impact, so she would need to take as much rest as possible.

   Bastian dimmed the lamp's light and gently brushed the hair from Odette’s pale face and revealed the cut on her neck. No doubt it had come from the very knife Franz had stabbed him in the shoulder with, but it wasn’t a deep wr and Bastian found himself feeling glad of this.

   He leaned back in his chair and watched her sleep. Margrethe stirred and instead of growling at him like she always did, she lazily waddled over and curled up on his toes.    The bandaging around her paws was a proud battle scar earned while defending its owner. Bastian leaned down and scratched Margrethe behind the ears. She bared her teeth at him, but stopped when she realised Bastian was giving her fusses.

As he looked closely, Bastian noticed bandages on the dog's back and waist. It made him reconsider his earlier belief that she  was useless dog. Margrethe's tiny body stiffened and trembled when Bastian picked her up and placed her on his lap.  From her new vantage point, Margrethe could see her master, asleep on the bed and she began to yip excitedly. 

   “Shhh…” Bastian hissed, but it was already too late. Margrethe already leap onto the bed to nuzzle into Odette’s arm. He quickly stood up from his seat to get her, but then Odette unexpectedly opened her eyes.

   “Meg….?” Odette said dreamily.

   Bastian gave up and took a step back, letting Odette caressed and spoiled the dog. He stood on the window, watching their exchange of kisses and licks.

  When he reflected on the reckless actions he had taken earlier in the day, a sense of emptiness washed over him once more. 

He concluded the last round of negotiations and turned down Duke Laviere's desire to continue their cooperative relationship. The Illis Company was prepared to shoulder the financial losses resulting from the termination of the joint venture.


He was set to lose a considerable amount of money for going against the board of directors wishes. Despite his teacher's warnings, he remained committed to his choice and covered his losses using his personal funds, because he no longer wanted to have any ties with Sandrine.

He had given up everything,  made his choice and abandoned responsibility, went against his grandfather's dying wishes, just for this woman.

   “Bastian?” A soft voice drifted through Bastian’s thoughts.

   Bastian sighed and returned to the land of the living. When his eyes met hers, Odette smiled like a polite stranger.

   “Thank you for bringing Meg back to me,” Odette said, while holding the dog deep in her arms.  As if she was afraid of losing her again.   “You were hurt quite badly, are you okay?”

   Bastian simply nodded, as he became consciously aware of the itch in the back of his shoulder. 

Once the last remnants of the sunset's glow faded away, the bedroom plunged into total darkness. Odette looked at him and held her breath. He was not wearing his uniform, but he still had the bearing of a soldier taught never to complain. Odette decided not to press the issue and definitely not mention Franz around him, the mansion was in a delicate calm, which could shatter at the slightest motion.

"Master, Dr. Kramer has arrived," announced Lovis from outside the door.

Odette watched him as he made his way to the door, his posture remained as stoic as the ruthless man she had known until now.

When the door finally opened, the time they spent gazing into each other's eyes began to feel like a distant dream. Until the door softly closed, Bastian never turned back.



Doctor Kramer frowned as he peeled away Bastian’s bloody bandages. The wound was a lot worse than he initially thought.

   “I distinctly remember telling you not to overdo it,” Doctor Kramer said as he disinfected the wound. 

Bastian's left shoulder was deeply injured after Franz stabbed him with a knife. Fortunately, the stab didn't damage his bones and muscles, but his condition was still quite serious.

   Bastian winced as Doctor Kramer cleaned and disinfected the wound, he got the impression the Doctor was being none too gentle, as punishment for not taking care of himself. Although the pain was significant, Bastian endured it silently.

   “Thank you Doctor,” Bastian said, once the doctor was done applying fresh bandages. He rose calmly and donned a fresh shirt, concealing his scarred body beneath the opulent fabric in an instant.

   “Please consider taking some sick leave for a few days.”

   “Yes, I will,” Bastian said with a slick smile.

Doctor Kramer prescribed him a course of painkillers and didn’t move until Bastian had taken the pills, as if he did not trust him. He looked as strong as ever, but deep lines of fatigue were evident in his face.

Dr. Kramer understood his relentless dedication, knowing that Bastian never allowed his injured body to rest in the time like this. The Klauswitz family's reputation was going from bad to worse.  Bastian Klauswitz was a name that represented an emerging power in the capitalistic empire, coupled with the scandal sparked by Franz Klauswitz, it left Bastian with very little room to rest. At the current trend, it was pretty clear that things were only going to get worse for Bastian.

   The scandal ran deep through the city and while most of the discerning public had their attention on Franz, who had attempted to kidnap Odette, there were still some fraternities that were using the scandal to revoke Bastian’s membership.

   He still could not abandon his wife and child, they were innocent in all of this. Bastian started to feel cornered and his opponents no doubt felt that too, which was why they were targetting him so ruthlessly.

   “Master, there is a guest,” a servant said, Bastian hadn’t even notice them coming into the room.

   Bastian didn’t answer, he finished buttoning his waist coat and made for the guest parlour, leaving Doctor Kramer alone to tidy away his equipment.

   “Countess Trier is waiting for you, sir,” Lovis said as he followed Bastian. “She said she has come to deliver a message from the Emperor.”



  Countess Trier greeted Bastian stiffly and the fact that she had not removed her hat or gloves suggested that she had no intention of staying.

   Bastian greeted her politely and she gave him a stern glance in return, her eyes did not hide the hostility in them and this outward aggression was a far cry from her disposition toward Bastian the last time they met.

   “I do not want to take up too much of your time,” Countess Trier said, holding out a letter to Bastian.

   Bastian accepted the letter as if given to him by the Emperor himself. The cold hatred in the Countess’ eyes never left him. She was still reeling from the news that Odette had been imprisoned by her own husband.

   She couldn’t believe it when she was told. She knew that their relationship was an unusual one and what was seen in public was not necessarily what happened behind closed doors, but she still assumed they actually loved each other. She thought Bastian was not a heartless man to abuse his wife, pregnant with his child.

   Bastian read through the letter, which explicitly directed Bastian toward divorcing Odette. Countess Trier did her best to keep her anger under control, but it was hard in the presence of such an unscrupulous man.

   She had gone to the palace the very morning after the Klauswitz brothers had turned the whole city on its head, and used it to plead with the Emperor. She had expected him to maintain a neutral stance on the situation and would be more concerned with maintain the hero’s honour than worrying about his niece, but she was wrong. The Emperor unexpectedly co-operated.

   In her heart, she wanted the entire Klauswitz family punished for their transgressions, but the Emperor had different intentions in mind. Bastian was a hero, symbol of the glory of Berg’s Navy, the Emperor did not want such a hero to fall and tarnish the nations reputation. Thanks to this, Bastian managed to escape proper persecution.

   “You understand? I can see that you do, so, let me pick up Odette, we will be leaving now,” Countess Trier said.

   “I’m sorry, but that would be a little difficult,” Bastian said. He approached her, standing like a huge wall, blocking her path.

   Countess Trier looked at Bastian, the shock in her eyes made them twinkle like fire. “Are you seriously disobeying an imperial order?”

Bastian remained calm as he listened to her harsh word. The courteous smile that still played on his lips, made him appear more disrespectful. 

"Yes, Countess," Bastian replied softly, his eyes lowered like the depths of the night as he met her gaze. "I will raise my objection."

Chapter 142.

Steel Wall.


  The Emperor’s dog just bit the owners hand.

   “Look, Major Klauswitz…”

   “I will follow any orders issued by the Emperor, given that he is the military governor of the Empire, but my wife is outside military jurisdiction, so I am not obliged to obey blindly,” Bastian said, committing to his disobedience with respect and loyalty.

   Countess Trier held her breath. Bastian was like a sharp blade that threatened to cut anything in its path. The Countess became even more concerned for Odette’s safety.

   “The Emperor is Odette’s Uncle, which precedes any military rank. That alone is the only thing you need to be thinking about,” Countess Trier said, trying not to let venom lace her words.

   “Well, Countess,” Bastian said with a soft sigh. “If the Emperor really took his Uncle status seriously, he would not have given Odette away. I would have thought you would have realised that better than anyone else.”

   “My God, Major Klauswitz, you really think you have a leg to stand on when you insult the imperial family like that?” Countess Trier was going red with anger.

   “I apologise, I did not think the truth would make you feel so uncomfortable, Countess, please forgive me.” Bastian showed regret with impeccable courtesy. “I have legitimate right to my wife. Tell the Emperor just because he was bestowed with the imperial mandate, does not mean that he can take away using the imperial mandate,” Bastian turned away from Countess Trier.

   The Countess reeled at the insult and had to steady herself on the back of the chair. “Odette can not bring you any benefits any more, you can not use her as a shield against what is coming for you, Bastian.” Countess Trier fumed as she spoke, allowing her voice to raise. “The Emperor is not blind to your efforts, he is willing to let you maintain the benefits you have enjoyed and you will continue to enjoy, out of respect for your titles and deeds, just not with Odette.”

   Bastian stopped as his hand reached for the door knob. It seemed that this greedy little monster will only cooperate if he knows his profits will remain intact.

   Bastian looked over his shoulder at Countess Trier and smiled. “I am well aware that His Majesty has offered excellent trade terms.”

   “Then give up your foolish pride, its what’s best for you.”

   “That’s bullshit. This matter can be resolved other ways,” Bastian declared confidently. The Countess was left speechless. “It is getting late, have a safe journey home, Countess.” Bastian left without saying another word.

   Trembling with anger and contempt, Countess Trier sat down heavily on the sofa. Bastian Klauswitz was like talking to a brick wall. Any further talks seemed a pointless avenue, they were going to have to find another way.



“Please, eat a little more,” the servant said softly.

   Odette shook her head slightly and put down the napkin after dabbing the corners of her mouth. It had been five days since that horrid night and her hunger had yet to return.

   “Have you already forgotten the doctors orders? You must eat for the sake of the baby.”

   “That’s new,” Odette said, trying to divert attention.

   “What is, ma’am?”

   “It reminds me of cucumber sandwiches and lemonade.”

   Dora was confused, but pressed on. “If you leave your tomato soup, I will be disappointed.”

   Dora cleared away the half eaten meal before Odette and prepared the next course. Doctor Kramer had insisted that Odette must be well fed for the baby to grow healthy, and although Bastian had never said anything, Dora knew he felt the same way.

   “Now, just eat as much as you can of this,” Dora said, placing the bowl of soup in front of Odette, complete with freshly baked bread.

   In the time it had taken Dora to prepare the soup, Odette had dozed off in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. Odette opened her eyes, startled when Dora placed the bowl in front of her. After a little struggle, Odette finally held the spoon.

   Odette’s second meal was not finished until late afternoon and by the time Dora helped Odette bath and change into her nightgown, it was already sunset.

   After tucking Odette into bed, Dora brought Margrethe into the room as a matter of course. Usually, Bastian would have returned home by now, but Margrethe’s silence suggested he had not.

   Bastian return home was never fixed. Sometimes it would be late in the afternoon, deep into the night or not until the next morning. In each case, he would stop by for a brief visit, then leave again once he had checked everything was okay. He didn’t even bother to say hello or goodbye to Odette.

Perhaps that's why it all felt like a dream. His face bathed in the gentle blue dawn. His quiet footsteps came with the sunset. The sight of him departing with the moonlight behind. All of it, every moment. If it weren't for the warmth of Margrethe's embrace, she might have believed their first-day conversation was merely another dream.

   “Don’t be too sad,” Dora said to Odette. “It’s because master is busy, doing his best to protect you.”

   “Yes…” Odette replied dreamily.

   “Still, it would be nice if he came back early on your birthday. Its been three years since you got married and not once have you spent a birthday together.”

   “Yes…” Odette said, allowing her eyes to close. She noticed her birthday was approaching, but there was no excitement to be found.

Dora stayed by the head of the bed until Odette drifted off to sleep.

   Odette dreamed away.

   Bastian gave Margrethe back and she was happy.

   Bastian returned her child and she was happy.

   Bastian said goodbye and she watched him go, stared at his back to make sure he really left. She watched him get swallowed by the bright, midday sun.



There was a lot of reasons to celebrate. Establishment of the continents largest steel company, stock offerings that reaped unprecedented profits and successfully re-bidding of the railroad linking Felia with Belov. It was a year of monumental success, but the mood was very conservative, out of respect for the owner, who was not in a festive mood.

   The closing ceremony ended with a short speech from Bastian. As he stepped down from the podium to the sound of respectful applause, Thomas Muller approached Bastian to shake his hand.

   “Its all thanks to you, Mister Director,” Bastian smiled and shook his hand. 

   His fathers downfall had happened a lot quicker than anyone predicted. Jeff Klauswitz ran all over town, putting out fires as they happened, but he hit his limit and things fell apart. His reputation was in tatters, and his heirs held the worlds ire. Bastian already got his revenge.

   The fulfilment of his life long goal was at hand, but he struggled to find the joy in his victory. He was just exhausted.

   “I heard your father threw the shipping stocks.”

   “Yes. He’s trying to raise funds to save the railroad, but its already too late.”

   “Then we can finish the job as soon as its over. Why don’t you give it a proper finish?” Thomas Muller said.

   Bastian shook his head and smiled. “No, this is enough achievement for my grandfather.”

   “Of course it is, if its your will, I will follow it.” Thomas said, a little regret in his tone.

   Bastian found it would be much more beneficial for his reputation if he let go now, instead of pushing his limits, which would only provoke sympathy for the dying tycoon. Especially with how fickle public opinion can be.

   “Well, why don’t you cheer up a little then? Everything’s worked out great,” Thomas said sincerely.

   Ever since Bastian took control of the Steel industry, things were getting heated, but thanks to Franz’s self destruction, that heat died away as all their enemies directed their attention at Bastian and not the company.

   The false accusations that he was abusing his wife resurfaced and that he was a child who ate his father. Bastian felt like this was going to be his final chance and that if he could just get through this crisis, he could leap far beyond the reach of such jealousy.

"It seems like the case will be resolved without complications. I had a conversation with the police chief this afternoon, and he confirmed that it has been classified as self-defense, with no plans for further investigation."

"Thank you, Mr. Director, and I look forward to seeing you in the new year." Bastian left the celebrations early and made his way out of the building to a car that was waiting for him. The driver saw him approach and opened the passenger door. It was unlikely that Bastian would be able to get behind the wheel himself for awhile.

   Bastian wasted no time and climbed into the back seat, leaning his head back, he closed his eyes. The headache was already starting up, maybe it was from the lack of sleep.

   Overcome with fatigue, by the time Bastian opened his eyes, he was already pulling into the centre of Preve Boulevard. The city was blanketed with festive cheer and decoration. Colourful lights, loud music and the smell of roasted nuts.

   As Bastian looked out at the world with tired eyes, he realised that time had flown by too quickly. It would be Odette’s birthday soon.

Chapter 143.
A Broken Shard of Porcelain.


Odette sensed the presence of the man behind her, as quiet as he was, she could feel him there. It was a feeling, too vibrant for mere dreams.

Bastian had returned.

An unbidden sigh slipped from her. Engulfed in thoughts, she pulled Margrethe closer and hoped sleep would return.

She held onto the memory of Bastian's voice and warmth that had swept away her solitary fears. She was surprised to find that she welcomed him, yet, she resented herself for feeling joy at him being there. Her feelings toward him had become a paradox, like the shadows that deepened in the presence of brighter light.

   Ever since she had first met him, since the afternoon when flowers bloomed, capturing her heart, she thought he was like the radiant sun. He shone through his own strength, brighter than anyone else, but in his presence, she could feel the shadow over her life, a shadow she had never felt before. It was a strange feeling that undermined the pride she had always felt.

   She always promised that, no matter what happened, even if she had to become a broken shard of porcelain, she would protect her heart, so that she could sparkle equally under his brilliance. 

Her dream, perhaps futile, was to be remembered as a beacon as he was. All she wanted was to be a presence just like that man.  Even though she felt ashamed of wanting to be her own luminary, she couldn’t stop feeling like that, even in the midst of adversity.

   Unable to sleep now that her mind was racing through thoughts. Odette opened her eyes and stared out at the moonlit room. Margrethe sensed Odette’s restlessness and looked up, whimpering.

   Odette did her best to try and sooth Margrethe, but the dog wriggled free of her embrace and started barking, shattering the peaceful night.

   Hurriedly, Odette got out of bed to grab the dog before she could make any more noise. Margrethe had padded over to Bastian’s side of the bed, but luckily he remained asleep, it was amazing what military types could sleep through.

   It was at that moment Odette realised something wasn’t quite right. She could see, in the moonlight, that Bastian was sprawled out on the bed, still clothed. Odette inched closer to see if he had been drinking, there wasn’t even the modest smell of alcohol.

   “....Bastian?”

   Odette called out his name softly and turned on the bedside lamp. Upon seeing him more clearly, her heart sank. He looked ashen faced, covered in sweat and his breathing was fast and laboured.

   “Bastian,” Odette started to call louder.

    She shook him and when he didn’t react, she turned to fetch help, but as she did so, Bastian had shot out and grabbed her wrist.

   Odette turned back to him, her heart leaping into her mouth and saw him staring up at her. Bastian looked at her with an empty and distant expression. He looked like a dreamer who had awakened, yet still dwelled in the realm of dreams.

   Odette had seen this before and knew she just needed to stay calm and let him come to his senses. Bastian closed his eyes, his face became more relaxed and the grip on her wrist weakened.

   Carefully recovering her wrist from his grip, she touched his forehead, he was burning up. She was astounded that anyone could survive temperatures that high. She didn’t want to wake him again, and rang the service bell.

Urgent chimes began to toll, disrupting the tranquility of the mansion in the early morning hours."



“I am sorry, but there is no room for negotiation,” Maximin said, maintaining his polite composure.


-But Count Xanders, to be dismissed because of one mistake is kind of excessive, don’t you think?- 

the voice on the other end of the phone said.

   Maximin got up from his desk and walked to the window. The sky outside was billowing with grey clouds, indicating a snow storm might hit them soon.

   “Maliciously insulting a noble lady, a victim of a crime no less, and labelling it as just one mistake, is being overly lenient, don’t you think?” Maximin countered the man on the phone.

   One of the members of the artistic community had boasted about scouring the black market for a surviving copy that contained the rather problematic painting of Odette. He then went on to ridicule the junk dealer's grandson who had spent an awful lot of money to have the magazines discontinued and then made fun of the beggar princess.

   When Maximin heard about this, he did not hesitate in acting. He found the young man, snatched away the magazine and threw it into the fire, much to the chagrin of the gang of young artists.

   “I have made my decision in accordance with standard regulations,” Maximin asserted himself.

   When the committee met, they agreed to have the problematic young man expelled and no sooner had the word got out, than Maximin was bombarded with calls from others to show some leniency. This was just one of the many phone calls.

 

 -How can you be so inflexible, are you trying to alienate yourself from social circle?-

the caller said.

   “Hasn’t Major Klauswitz, who is also just another victim of this scandal, also being ostracised too? If the committee were to turn a blind eye to this, then it will only be seen as biassed.”

  -Who’s side are you really on?-

   “I am on nobody's side, I only wish to protect the privacy and morals of innocent victims.”

-Look here, Count Xanders…-

   “I have to go, I will be late for my next appointment. I will see you at the next gathering,” Maximin said, ending the conversation.

   Maximin turned as he heard tiny footsteps at the door of his office and sure enough, Alma stood there, patiently waiting for him.

   “Please, come in my princess,” Maximin said.

   Alma came in with joy all over her face, she did a little twirl to show her daddy the new, sparkling dress she was wearing.

   “So, are we heading to the party now, daddy?”

   “Yes, that’s right. Sorry to have kept you waiting.”

   “Do you think the people at the party will think I’m pretty?” Alma said, turning serious.

   Maximin nodded his head enthusiastically. “Of course. Everyone will be surprised to see how pretty you’ve become.”

   “Like Lady Klauswitz?”

   “Ah, well, no, I don’t think Lady Klauswitz will be there.”

   “Why, is she sick?”

   “Do you want to see her?”

 "Yes, very much.  Lady Klauswitz doesn't want to see us?”  Alma said, looking up at Maximin sullenly.

   Before he could say anything more, the phone started ringing and Maximin gave it a pensive look before picking up the receiver.

-It's me, Count Xanders,-said Countess Trier on the other end. -I need to discuss matters of Odette’s situation with you. Could you spare some time?-

The name Odette had yearned for, Countess Trier, resonated from the other end of the line.



They had avoided the worst, the medicine that Doctor Kramer had given Bastian seemed to be working and although he still had a fever, the doctor was confident they had overcome a major crisis.

"Let's observe him a bit more; however, the threat of a grave condition seems to have waned for now."

   “Thank you doctor,” Odette said, tired from being awake all night and all day. The sky outside turned a rosy red as the sun set. From the moment she had found Bastian collapsed at dawn, only now did the weight of reality descend upon her, as time's passage whispered its truth.

   “Well, I did warn him not to overdo it. Fatigue, coupled with blood loss from the stab wound, has only made things worse, but, there doesn’t seem to be any tissue necrosis, so we should be fine. Tonight is crucial; if his fever doesn't rise further, he may start recovering," Dr. Kramer briefed her on Bastian's condition as he packed away his instruments.

   “He must have been in a lot of pain, but he didn’t show any signs of it,” Odette said.

  "Well, he used to be a child who didn't know how to care for himself, but he wasn't this foolish; I think his impatience got the better of him.” Dr. Kramer's eyes reddened as he gazed at the still-unconscious Bastian. He struggled to hide his emotions, but it became impossible. “The son of the woman who took away his mother and little sister's lives, now tried to harm his wife and child. It must have been difficult for him to keep his calm. He must have been so desperate to see his revenge complete, that he pushed himself too far. Because is the only way to protect his family."

   “What do you mean?” Odette said, confused.

   “Well, it's probably how he felt…”

  "No, Doctor. That wasn't what I meant."  Odette looked at Doctor Kramer, the confusion on her face only deepening. “Are you saying that Theodora Klauswitz…killed Bastian’s mother and sister?

   “Oh, my poor girl, I thought you knew.” It was Doctor Kramer’s turn to look confused. “I’m sorry, Mrs Klauswitz, I’ve said far too much.” Doctor Kramer grabbed his medical bag and made for the door.

   “Please, wait, Doctor,” Odette called after him and rose from her seat.

As twilight colored the sky and the sea beyond the window, Dr. Kramer's gaze fixed on Odette was as deep as the darkening scenery.

Chapter 144.
Map Of Scars.


The light in Odette’s bedroom never went out. Dr. Kramer came through constantly to check up on Bastian and the maids helped to cool his fever. Odette sat in a chair by the fireplace and watched everything.

   Her mind did not register the people moving around her though, her mind was entirely on what Doctor Kramer had told. The tragic story of a woman, betrayed by her cherished love, and her abandoned son. So ghastly it verged on unbelievable, yet it was an undeniable truth. The doctor didn’t seem like the person to make up such a story. 

   Why, why did you do this!

   Bastian’s angered shouts rang through her head, images of his intense eyes at the moment he had discovered her betrayal.

   She could finally understand the state of his mind on that day. Why he had been so furious, why he decided to be so cruel in his revenge, why he couldn’t let go of the relationship that was destroying the pair of them. 

She understood it all.

   “His fever seems to have finally cooled,” said Dora, as she patted Bastian’s forehead.

   Odette rose from her seat and approached the bedside as Dr. Kramer remove the intravenous needle from Bastian's arm.  Bastian was still unconscious and his scarred body was exposed as the sheets had all been pulled back to help with the cooling.

   “Would you like for me to set you up a bed in another room, so that you may get some rest?” Dora said. Odette only answered with a shake of her head as she sat on the edge of the bed. 

She looked down at Bastian lost and helpless. There was a deep and ragged looking scar on his chest that crinkled and flexed as he breathed. His shoulders, arms, stomach and waist, everywhere she looked there was only pain, but Odette couldn’t look away.


His body was like a map of scars. The hidden truth, unknown to her, swept in like a tender yet mighty tidal wave, enveloping her heart.

She had never really looked at him before, never seen him properly. She thought that unnecessary attention was only going to make things complicated, in a relationship that was entirely fake.

Amidst her life's desert, she sought not to be an aimless wanderer, lured by the mirage of an oasis. She shielded herself, closing her eyes and covering her ears. Yet the very sanctuary she pursued was but the heart of the barren wasteland, where her beautiful illusion vanished within the tempestuous sands.

   She regretted the past, when she was in a hurry to avoid reality. She only felt resentment toward him for hiding himself. She hated herself for making such rash decisions that only served to make things worse, and she was saddened by the truth she had only just learned that nothing can be undone. 

As she grappled with the tumultuous tempest within, emotions aflame with rage or perhaps something deeper, the maids started to cleanse Bastian. A subtle crack appeared in her gaze as she silently watched the scene.

   He was a man that strived for perfection in everything. He didn’t tolerate the tiniest bit of imperfection, which made him appear stern. This had the effect of strengthening his body, but his mind was still frail and left him in a condition where others had to take care of him. It felt as though she had beheld the collapse of a once-mighty fortress.

   “Please step aside, I will take it from here,” Odette said impulsively and rose from her seat.   

 “But madam… his condition is still…” 

   “Thank you for all your efforts, but you can leave it to me now, go, rest.” Odette ordered the servants from the room. “I will personally nurse my husband back to health.  It might be better for Bastian to rest if I take care of him myself. It is okay, Doctor?"

“It’s not a critical condition and I don’t think it will be a big problem, but I have concerns about your well-being, Mrs. Klauswitz."

“I will be careful not to overdo it. If I get tired, I will ask for help, so don’t worry.”

Dr. Kramer, his eyes filled with compassion as if understanding her feeling, sighed in resignation and nodded. “Fine,. I will respect your wishes."

“Thank you for your understanding, doctor.” 


After Dr. Kramer departed after giving instructions and emergency medicine, which the servants promptly followed. The room plunged into a silence deep as the undersea realm. When she was finally left alone, Odette picked up the hand towel and began cleaning Bastian from his head to his toes. All the while he remained still and asleep.


After she finished, she carefully covered his chilled form with a blanket and returned to her seat. Margrethe, who had been restlessly pacing by the bed, settled back on the pillows near the fireplace.

Odette glared at Bastian with reddened eyes. 

This was unfair. 

How dare he make her feel this way, at a time like this, with this pitiful appearance and making her feel these conflicting emotions. 

With this development, she found it nearly impossible to hate him and it tore at her heart.

   Suppressing the impulse to scream, Odette moved to the window and looked at the the sea's darkness outside then turned to Bastian in his bed. Night deepened as this cycle continued.

She had reached her limits. 

Odette sighed, eyeing the damp towel in the basin. What a foolish if she prioritized this man…. Her body, not yet fully healed, now was the time to think about taking care of herself and the baby in her belly.

Odette wiped her wet hands but when she picked up the service bell, she found it impossible to ring.

Shadows flittered across the room, like a hurricane of snow petals. Outside the window, a gentle, white descent from the heavens.

Snow graced the earth, quiet descent on the silent sea, as if muting the world's chorus. Her hands, freed from the bell string, cradled her burgeoning belly.

Soft as a snowfall, Odette walked to Bastian's side, his fever waxing, his breaths uneven. Quietly, she shed her scarf instead of wetting the towel. Her belt, then her dress, followed the shawl's path to the floor.

In a moment's hesitation, Odette gently loosed her nightgown's neckline. The muted rustle of silken fabric, tracing her seamless skin, harmoniously shared the silence with the serene snowfall, crafting a symphony of tranquillity on this silent night.



The pain from his scar was what woke him. A burning sensation in his shoulder. Bastian roused and laughed, the pain was an illusion, a sensory abnormality. Even in a semi-conscious state, he was able to convince himself that the pain was a lie and ignore it.

   He caught his breath as he chanted the pain is a lie over and over like a spell. It was like any other time he had awoken to the pain, though he did feel it a little more difficult this time, like he was trying to claw his way out of a swamp.

‘It hurt.‘

   Bastian sat up and couldn’t help but pant as if he was a wounded dog. He got images of being in a frozen forest on the afternoon of a hunt, where he was then discovered by the tutor. The tutor looked at him with deep, black eyes and a sign that the cruelty had only just begun.

   The deep black eyes resolved to a dog, one that he had been ordered to shoot, but he didn’t want to. It was no different to shooting a rabbit or a deer, but for some reason, he  couldn’t bring himself to do it.

'No. I don't want to.' 

Shortly after refusing, the rifle's trigger struck his face, dismounting him from his horse. Only then, grounded, did he grasp what had happened to him. 

Blood trickled from his nose and lips, staining his face. His tutor, a retired military officer, advocated corporal punishment as the ultimate form of discipline. For staring impolitely or daring to respond, each day his tutor found endless unreasonable reasons to punish him. Had the dog not appeared, another excuse would have simply taken its place.

Bastian delicately swept the blood with his sleeve's edge, standing resolute as he awaited the next punishment.  The tutor dismounted, marching towards him like a raging bull.

   Bastian could still feel the sting of the first slap and then the next and the next one after that. He endured the merciless slaps without letting out a single scream.The tutor was unrelenting in his punishment, but Bastian felt relief that the sudden aggression had scared off the dog, who bounded away into the under brush, out of sight. Then a military's boot met his abdomen, marking the day's brutal epilogue.

When he woke up, Bastian found himself in bed, his wounds tended to as usual. That very night, as pain kept him awake, he made a decision :  if he ever encountered the dog again, he would pull the trigger.

However, as the frostbound forest yields to thaw's touch, birthing leaflets and blossoming floras, the dog still remains in Bastian's world.  As a result, he found himself repeatedly defying his tutor's commands, enduring disguised physical punishment each time.  Eventually, he grew sick of the dog's presence around him.

 It was the day he decided that tomorrow he would part ways with the dog for good.

Drained from an overwhelming amount of homework, Bastian succumbed to slumber, only to awaken on a forest path bathed in lunar glow.  Soft whispers of spring's foliage unfurling to the wind awakened his memorised ritual. 

He forgot to tie his wrists. 

Glancing down at her grimy nightgown and bare feet, he realised his mistake. When he punished himself for his carelessness,  a familiar bark echoed in the distance - that of the dog, which he had planned to shoot and kill at daybreak.

The moment he stared into the mutts eyes and saw himself reflected back, he knew. The dog kept him company as he walked the forest path in the middle of the night.

As Bastian's senses swam in reverie, the dog drew near.  Its adoring eyes shone brightly in the moonlight. Though aware he should go back, Bastian irresistibly enthralled by it tender sight.

The dog tenderly licked Bastian's wounded feet, then nestling against his quivering hand. Its warm, soft fur broke down his defences and as he hugged it tightly, he realised that he was very much alone.

He hated the dog for making him aware of his solitude; an ironic twist, it’s also the reason why he loved it.

   The only thing left to do is kill her. Franz’s voice rang through Bastian’s swimming head. That’s your way, isn’t it? You love something so you destroy it.

   Somewhere, deep in the dark reaches of his fevered thoughts, a gunshot echoed, underlined with manic laughter.

   The laughter sounded like his name and he swam back to consciousness and the pain, but there was also a voice, a soft angelic voice.

   'Bastian.'

  It called to him. 

'Bastian.'

   Something touched him where it hurt the most. He gasped for breath and opened his eyes. He realised he recognised the voice. 

It was his wife.

Odette.

Chapter 145.


Just a little more.



His blue eyes struggled to focus and although they looked at her, they seemed glazed over, as if trying to look at a memory.

   Slowly, those blue eyes became clear and focused. She was still held a hand to his chest, feeling the comforting rhythm of his heart. A moment ago, when he was suffering from nightmares, it was beating like a drum.

   Before she could say anything to Bastian, his eyes fluttered and were closed again, he lay back and was a lot more calm in his sleep or at least, Odette thought so, until Bastian squirmed deeper into her.

   All Odette could do was blink in confusion as Bastian nuzzled into the nape of her neck. His arms wrapped around her and held her close. As if being chased by something, he was trying to curl up on her lap, but he was far too big for that.

   He clung to her fiercely and Odette could not pull herself out of his grasp. Instead, she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him to her, stroking his back. It was something she was used to doing, back when Tira used to have horrible nightmares. Though he was a lot different to her younger sister's frame.

After correcting his awkward position, Odette carefully pulled up the blanket and wrapped it around him. By hugging, they balanced each other's body temperature, even his temperature not fully returning to normal, he was now in a stable condition.


The room fell back into still silence, even Bastian’s hard breathing settled to a barely audible murmur.

   Odette was lost for what to do now. As she brushed a strand of hair from his face, her head was a blizzard of questions. 

What were they going to do now? 

Could they forgive each other after so much hate? 

Would they be able to move forward or was this just a brief reprieve from all the abuse?

Odette hugged Bastian more tightly.

The shadows of her eyes drifted across their shared bed, a shipwreck adrift in the starless sea, journeying ceaselessly until dawn's gentle light painted the edge of the horizon.



“How could you do this to me, Father?” Theodora Klauswitz screamed.

   Tears flowed down her puffy red cheeks like a water fall as the echoes of her shouts resounded through the mansion. “Please, help me one more time. If we don’t stop the draft by the end of the week, shipping will collapse and you know who’s waiting to swallow it whole,” Theodora was shouting down the receiver.

   -The tables have turned, came the voice on the other end. ‘Even if you were able to block the bill, it will change nothing.-

“But if you give up, what about Franz? Please at least think of him… .”

-Don’t you say his name to me, I never want to hear it again. That kid  is no longer related to our family!-

“But, father…”

  -No, the relationship with Klauswitz ends here. If you refuse to divorce him, I will have no choice but to cut you off too.-

   Viscount Oswald had been someone that would have done anything for his daughter. He even let her marry a man who already had a wife. So she knew that if her father turned her back to her, there would be no room to compromise.

Franz's scandalous painting would ultimately deeply affect the entire family. This, coupled with the significant losses from Bastian's scheme, spelled the inevitable downfall of Berg's railway tycoon, Jeff Klauswitz. He had the opportunity to rescue the rest of his business by letting go of the railroad company, but instead, he made a grave mistake by losing his temper and acting impulsively.

  -Its all done for, Theodora, you must see that. Get yourself out before its too late.-

   “No, I love Jeff Klauswitz and that will never change.”

   Theodora slammed the phone down and rose from her seat, enslaved by an eerie obsession. the brilliant sunlight from the clear heavens lanced her crimson, wearied eyes. She’s not wrong. 

Her love for Jeff was second to none. For this man she'd give it all; life itself. Should hellfires claim him, with honor, she'd descend to defend their love.

   A knock came from the door. “Madam, its me.” Theodora recognised the voice of Nancy, who had gone to see the apothecary.  

   “Please, come in,” Theodora said.

   Nancy came into the room and beckoned another young girl to come in after her. Theodora felt like she had seen the girl some where before.

   “Good Afternoon, madam. I’m Molly, Aunt Nancy’s niece.”

   That’s when Theodora remembered the spy she had used some time ago. She was sure she had served her use and had been discarded.

   “What’s this?” Theodora said, upset. “I’m pretty sure that I told you to find me someone useful.” Theodora looked at Nancy, waiting for an explanation.

   “I asked my Aunt to give me one more chance.”

   “You’re a little over confident, speaking out of turn, especially after being accused of thievery from your last client.” Theodora laughed, but Molly didn’t even so much as twitch an eyebrow.

   “I still think I am the right person for the job. No one knows them or the mansion as well as I do.”

   “Well, that’s good then, oh, but wait, there’s just one little snag. For a spy to be affective, they can’t have had their cover blown before they’ve even started.”

   “I know it wont be easy, but that doesn’t mean there are ways,” Molly said, revealing a newspaper that she placed in front of Theodora.

   Theodora’s eyes went wide when she saw the headline.

   Theodora knew her father was right, she knew that, but she couldn’t just let Sophia’s son eat Franz alive. There was one thing else that Theodora knew, she held a favourable hand in this game and she was not going to relent until Bastian lay broken at her feet.

The hour had arrived for her long-buried wish to bloom. She knew the moment she witnessed Bastian held Odette in the chaos

He had found the next dog.

A kid, beautiful, noble breed dog, even pregnant with puppies, this time.

   “Are you ready to do what ever it takes?” Theodora said to Molly.

   “Yes, anything,” Molly looked pensive for a second. “But this time I’m going to need half the costs up front.”

   “What? You really think that I am willing to gamble like this?”

   “I don’t know, but its going to be a fairly dangerous job. Wouldn’t you want something upfront first?” Molly smiled innocently.

   Theodora stared at Molly, then burst out laughing. Molly was quite crazy, just the person Theodora needed for a job like this.

"So, what's your asking price?"

 “I hope you give me the same amount of compensation you promised me last time.” Molly said without hesitation. 

Theodora stared at her brazen face, then slowly stood up and walked towards the window.

Today, Bastian's world across the bay glistened with resplendent brilliance.



He had to still be dreaming, there was no other explanation, but each time he closed his eyes and open them again, he could still see Odette there, laying beside him and holding him. She looked so relaxed and peaceful bathed in the morning sunlight. It was a sight he never thought he would see again.

   He wanted to reach out and brush the hair from her cheek, but he was afraid he might wake her and spoil this moment. He wanted to stay like this forever, with Odette in his arms and peacefully laying together. It didn’t last long as drowsiness flowed gently. he felt his eyelids grow heavy and he was back asleep again. He sensed a caress upon his back, yet his memory was shrouded in haze.

   When Bastian awoke again, the light was stronger and there was a soft hand touching his forehead. Too vivid was the feeling to be a mere dream. The rustle of hair on bedding vanished into the enveloping light. And soon, the cocooning warmth that swaddled him, faded to absence.

He opened his eyes and looked over just in time to see Odette push back her covers and made to sit up on the edge of the bed.

   “Don’t go..lay with me just a little longer.”

   Bastian reached over and wrapped his arms around Odette and pulled her in close.   Dream or reality It didn't matter either way.  Odette jumped in surprise, but she did not fight him off, she just sat there. He was happy with that, at least she did not try to break out of his embrace.

   He held onto her and gazed out the window at the sky. It was a tranquil serenade of repose that made him feel as if he was waltzing through yesteryears once more.

 He tried to recall through the sea of memories.

He remembered coming home feeling like his skin was on fire, but was covered in a cold sweat. He hadn’t mentioned it to any one. He figured a good nights sleep should be fine.

   He wanted to stay like this a little longer, unable to let her go.

   I love you. He wanted to say, but in the end, Bastian knew that bridge had been burnt to cinders.

   He never truly just wanted a child from her, it was an excuse to not let her go. He felt like he could not still desire her after her betrayal, but he couldn’t stop himself and living in denial was hurting everyone.

   There was a knock at the door. “Madam, Doctor Kramer wishes if he can see you.”

   Unlike Bastian, who didn't care, Odette jumped in surprise once more. “Oh, yes, let him know he can.”

   Odette pushed Bastian away, who didn’t fight it and let her go. Odette slid out of bed, her pale, naked figure glowed in the late morning light. Bastian couldn’t help but stare at her scrawny body. He paused when he saw her swollen belly. He had ruined something beautiful with rash action, yet, it still remained a sign of hope.

   Odette slipped on her nightgown. She gave a quick glance over her shoulder at Bastian, but didn’t say anything. 

Dressed in her nightgown and robe, Odette went to her dressing table and brushed her hair. Just as she wrapped herself in a lace shawl, another knock came at the door and Doctor Kramer came in.

Chapter 146.


Opened the Door.



By the time Odette had come out of the bath, the maids were done cleaning the room. The bed sheets were replaced and the patient that was supposed to be in them was no where to be seen. Already Bastian was being stubborn and not taking the doctors advice to rest as much as possible.

   Then she saw them. A bouquet of Irises lay on the table, next to a velvety box. 

"These are birthday presents for you, Madam." the had brought in a huge pile of gifts and flowers.

Odette looked at the greetings card on the bouquet. They were from some military family who had close ties with Bastian.

   Since she had gotten married to Bastian, every time her birthday came around, the gifts poured in from all sorts of people she had never met. She never thought others would show such enthusiasm for her birthday this year, when her reputation fell to the ground due to various scandals. 

   She was relived that Bastian had not died from the infected wound. They’d hurt each other enough and she didn’t want to spiral any more. She was done with mounting up debt.

 Odette busied herself organising all the greetings cards and getting the flowers into vases. Although they were all addressed to her, they were solely to curry favour with Bastian. She would have to leave him a list of people for him to look at.

   Odette found a gift that didn’t have a name on it. It would be a simple matter to call the maid and ask them who sent the gift, but she decided against it.

   She put the flowers into a spare vase and went to the bathroom to fill up the water. She stared absently at the swans on the tap and didn’t realise the water overflowed. Odette panicked and shut off the facet and dropped the flowers in her panic. The flower scattered over the now drenched bathroom floor.

   Subconsciously, she counted the flowers as she picked them up. There were twenty four of them, the same as her age. She looked at them lovingly as she brought them back into the bedroom and placed them on the table next to the red velvet box. When she carefully opened the lid, she found wonderfully wrapped chocolates in little, tiny compartments.

   There was one chocolate that was coin shaped and it reminded her of the chocolate she had bought in celebration of getting a new job. Her heart broke when she remembered she had dropped it in her attempts to run away from Bastian.

  Odette held the chocolate in her hand, her eyes filled with confusion and helplessness. Just as she was examining the twenty-four irises, she heard Margrethe barked and pawed at the glass doors leading out onto the balcony. 

Odette looked up, confused and saw that Bastian was stood out on the balcony, staring out of the sea with cigarette dangling between his fingers.  

   Doctor Kramer told her that it was lucky Bastian was in such peak physical condition. They would still need to monitor his progress, but so long as he did not get another fever, he should be fine. She was pretty sure that smoking in the cold air was not going to help.

   Odette stood at the door for awhile, watching him as he smoked. As he finished and turned to the door, Odette jumped back and pretended she was pottering about the room. She felt a cold blast of air as Bastian opened the door to let Margrethe out, he did not close it again and went back to the railing.

 Odette gathered her courage and stepped out onto the balcony. The world, caressed by overnight snow, dazzling in the beaming innocence of pure white.



“I think its time you went back inside”  Odette looked at the winter garden where white snowflakes were blooming and turned her head. “You’re not fully recovered and this cold air cant be doing you any good.” 

Bastian looked at her sidelong, her reproachful glare made his heart sink. It was absurd, but the feeling of being pitied was not all that bad.

  The wind, a tender courier cradling snow crystals, waltzed gracefully between them. Bastian noticed Odette shiver in the bitter cold, so he shrugged off the coat he had draped over his shoulders and tried to place it around Odette instead. She tried to make as if she did not need it, but Bastian was not taking no for an answer.

Bastian calmly buttoned his coat and finally raised the collar and wrapped it around her  neck   He could see that Odette was embarrassed, maybe she didn’t like the idea of taking clothes from a wounded soldier. Bastian didn’t put much thought in it, he looked out to the sea and listened to the crashing waves of icy water.

   “Thank you for dealing with the scandal and the accident,” Odette changed her mind about turning away and said the words she had prepared after thinking about it all night. 

   Bastian looked at her, trembling in an oversized coat, too embarrassed to look at him properly. His eyes were deep and calm, like a tranquil sea beneath the canvass of a crystalline day.

   “I know you’ve been through a lot because of me and got injured. I’m sorry for all the trouble I have caused. Now that I have recovered my health, I’m going to leave as soon as the holidays are over.”

   That’s it.

As she faced Bastian with an open mind, it seemed to her that she had finally understood: her hatred and resentment towards this man had lost their grip. 

   “I’m not just going to run away like I did last time. I want to stay in touch with you, so that you can maintain your right to be the father of our child, if Lady Laviere agrees, of course...”

   “No, I have nothing to do with Sandrine any more,” Bastian said. “I never wanted to be engaged with her, Odette, if you want to be the child's mother, then marry me.”

Bastian calmly shared the decision he had arrived at. He knew it was irrevocable, but he was not willing to let her go, he couldn’t.

   “No, Bastian, don’t do that,” Odette pleaded with him. “If its because you feel guilty over the scandal, you don’t have to. All I want is freedom and peace, not this sympathetic responsibility.”

 Guilt. 

Sympathy. 

Responsibility. 

The memory of their first meeting flashed through Bastian’s mind and deepened his despair.

   “Do I really look like the kind of person that would make such sacrifices and devotions under such petty guises?”

   The question was posed like Bastian was mocking himself.

   The Emperor had ordered the marriage out of Imperial interest. He now ordered a divorce to save Imperial honour. As if he only just realised the kind of man Bastian is.

   Countess Trier asked to be Odette’s guardian and the Emperor agreed. If they were to divorce, Odette would come under the protection of Countess Trier. She promised to support Odette with all her might. This would mean Odette would no longer be isolated and alone.

   Bastian knew that he had been wholly stripped of the position as Odette’s saviour. If he accepted the Emperor’s decree, Odette could begin a new life, a life she had so desperately wanted.

   “I want you, Odette,” Bastian finally said.

   He looked into her turquoise eye’s, which glittered like the scales of the sea. She was so beautiful. Beautiful enough to make him want to grab her and never let her go, even if it meant shackling this woman to the ruins of the life he had made for her.

   Bastian didn’t want to avoid that distorted desire any longer. She was his and no one was going to take her away from him, not even the Emperor.

   He wanted to have her, even if he had to deceive her and break her. Even if it meant keeping her blinded and deafened. He would have her and she would bare his child.

   “Madam, its Dora.” One of the servants came into the bedroom calling after Odette.

   “Yes, come in,” Odette said and left the balcony like she was trying to run away from him. Bastian put down the cigarette he had been holding and followed her.

   “Since you are both sick, I thought it would be an idea to have a birthday dinner up here,” Dora said.

   Odette shook her head. “No, Dora, that won’t be necessary.”

   “But this is the first birthday you two have spent together. Wouldn’t it be better to spend it together?” Dora looked at Odette pleadingly. then to Bastian, standing beside her. “How about celebrating your birthday even if it’s simple? As Dr. Kramer’s advice, I will prepare without putting too much strain on either of you.” 

  Dora was as stubborn as ever.


Silence answered her question, Bastian settled into a chair before the hearth, his gaze drawn to the sea beyond the window, now awash with the crimson blush of the closing year.


Chapter 147.


Sweet and Bitter.








An unusual night, indeed, Odette thought. She looked at the simple table set up in the room and meal set before her. The colourful cakes decorated around the bowl of soup for the patients was rather strange to look at, it was almost like she was in a vivid dream. 

As the servants departed, silence draped over them like a winter's night's cloak. Odette picked at her meal and felt like she was being punished with hospital food. All she had to do was put it in her mouth and swallow, there was no chance to properly taste the food.

   The soup bowl was half empty when Bastian stood up. Odette paused, leaving her spoon in the soup and watched Bastian walk over to a shelf, pull out a record and place it on the gramophone. Quickly the room filled with Odette’s favourite music.

   Bastian returned to the table. He donned a navy-blue sweater atop a tieless shirt. His wounds had barely started to heal, so his movements were slow and deliberate, yet  his posture stood tall and steps retained their valor. It was hard to believe this had been the same man who had tried to curl up on her embrace last night.

   Reclaiming his seat, Bastian resumed his meal as the mellow music filled the air. The music felt like it softened the mood a little, the same fantasy she had heard at the hotel, Rheinfeld’s Lounge.

   Odette didn’t really find music sentimental, but this song had remained with her for a long time. It reminded her of the spring afternoon when she had first heard it. She bought the record with the earnings of her first payment from getting married. She then bought the sheet music when she was allowed to play the piano.

   “Trill,” Bastian said, his voice blended with the ethereal and beautiful melody. “Don’t you think?”

   Odette lifted her head to look as Bastian, as his intentions became clear. She calmly nodded her head. The fire in the fireplace cast dark shadows on his face, which had become gaunt over the past few days. He looked like a grim spectre.

   As they looked at each other, the final movement of the orchestral music began. Odette averted her eyes, looking about the room to stop at the vase of iris’. The beautiful moment which had given birth to hope faded under the deception. A pain, unforgettable yet fleeting, flickered above her blue irises before it vanished.

   Its okay if you don’t behave with sincerity, the conviction still holds true. Odette thought. Why have we hurt each other so much?  It was a mistake she did not want to repeat.

   “Bastian?”

   As soon as Odette spoke, Margrethe started barking. Odette jumped at the sudden burst of noise and looked under the table. She did not realise Margrethe had snuck into the room and sat by Bastian.

   “No, Meg,” Odette admonished, but Margrethe didn’t move and just looked at Bastian.

   As Odette became agitated at Margrethe’s refusal to obey, Bastian slipped a bit of bread under the table and Meg lapped it up, her tail wagging in satisfaction. Noticing her joy, Bastian broke off another piece of bread and offered it to Margrethe.

   “Bastian, no,” Odette said. “She has already eaten, don’t give her more food or she will get fat.” Odette felt like she was trying to discipline two dogs.

   Margrethe sat at Bastian’s side, waiting for more food to come her way, but Bastian ignored her and pushed the bread plate to the centre of the table.

   Odette realised that her birthday celebrations were with two sick people and an injured dog. She couldn’t keep the laughter from her lips and let out a soft chuckle. Even though they all looked so pitiful, she enjoyed her birthday meal all the same.

   “There’s a villa in Lausanne, Odette, I think it would be beneficial for you to stay there until the baby is born,” Bastian said as calmly as if commenting on the weather. After days in thought, he realised ‘twas best for her.  First and foremost, it was time to focus on the final step to fulfill the given responsibility. to shield Odette and their child from this hell until they could touch dawn's light on a newly sprouted life, his soiled life would sully her no more.

“If you wish to go, you can discuss the logistics with Lovis and he will arrange everything.”

A homely abode, south facing and over looking a shimmering seascape. It was the sort of place Odette would have loved to live all year round.  Amongst his collection of grand estates, the villa in Lausanne resonated with her soul the most. He would keep searching for a new place if Odette didn't want to stay there until she find a place like it, no matter how many times. 

   “Bastian, I…”

   “Dessert is ready,” a servant said from the doorway.

   “Bring it in,” Bastian said without hesitation.



Odette had been pacing near the window when she heard the clock chime eleven times. She stopped her pacing and went to where Bastian lay. Nervously she touched his forehead and could still feel the presence of the fever. His body temperature felt normal. What was most comforting was that Bastian looked as if he was sleeping soundly, no signs of any of the nightmares from before.

   After checking, Odette sat in the chair next to the bed and watched Bastian sleep. The small birthday dinner last until late into the night and taking Bastian’s condition into consideration, she decided to let him stay in her bed tonight.

   Odette looked at his face damp with sweat. She decided to fetch a bowl of cold water and a face cloth to cool him down. Odette only realized Bastian's exhaustion after he had fallen asleep, having taken Dr. Kramer's prescribed medicine.

   I hope the child doesn’t inherit his stubborn impatience, Odette thought, as she wiped Bastian's face

   The bowl of water was placed on the table that, until an hour ago, was filled with presents. Now it only contained the Iris’ and the chocolates, the only present Odette wanted left in her room.

After double-checking that Bastian was sound asleep, Odette silently approached the table by the fireplace. Her fingers tenderly brushed the flower petals before reaching for the velvety box.

It was a gift from Bastian.

In truth, she had noticed it the very first time she laid eyes on it.

   Odette realised she had been staring at the box of chocolates and although she felt like she wanted to resist her primal desires to scoff the whole box, the craving was clearly what the baby wanted. Gingerly, as if a thief, she opened the box and ate one of the chocolates.

   She liberated the chocolate coins from their casket. The symphony of gold foil unfurling resonated, piercing the obsidian veil of the night. Odette savoured the sweet, delectable, silky smooth chocolate and it was gone already. She sighed and put another chocolate in her mouth. Again, the silky chocolate melted in her mouth and slid down to her tummy and made her feel warm inside.

   Something fluttered in her tummy. It was an odd sensation different from any cramp or pain she had ever felt. 

Memories of Tira's birth, a mysterious waltz in her womb, suddenly returned with vivid clarity.

   “Hello baby…” With a voice quivering as if in search of forgiveness, Odette tenderly stroked her belly, where their unborn child was growing.

   She felt a pang of guilt spasm through her mind as she thought about all the times before now, when she had tried to harm the baby, wanting to reject its presence inside her. The child responded with beautiful movements as if understanding the its mother’s  feelings. Once painful memories now morphed into overwhelming joy.

Odette scoffed the rest of the box of chocolates, unaware that Bastian was watching her with silent eyes, merging with the night.  

She caressed her belly and whispered something to herself, hastening to consume the sweets. Gold foil scattered across the table and several fell to the floor. When she was done stuffing her face, a deep sense of satisfaction filled her and she could do nothing but sit in the chair.

Bastian changed his mind about getting up. He had woken up the second the cold towel touched his forehead, but he didn’t want to open his eyes, so carried on pretending to be asleep. Perhaps the still peace held him back, a regret steeped in poignancy.

Her soliloquy, beginning with a mere greeting, grew longer. 

Baby.

Bastian recognised her whisper, a radiant smile adorned Odette's face -With a delicate touch of gold foil and her hand caressing her swelling belly, she beamed like a blossoming spring flower. The word he extracted from the scene, instantly emptied his mind of all else.

She had been speaking to the child in her womb the entire time, though Bastian couldn’t hear what she was saying, he found it endearing all the same.

   Not long after midnight, Odette finally got up from the chair she had crashed in and got ready to sleep.  After returning from the bathroom, she shed her scarf and robe, sinking into bed next to him. 

   The room was silent for a long time, save for the crackling of the fire and the hypnotic ticking of the clock. Odette was laid with her back to him and he smiled, waiting patiently.  Yet, the unshakeable regret lingered, bittersweet as the scent of chocolate on her.

   Finally, Bastian rolled onto his side to be the big spoon against Odette, her back to his chest, their legs entwined as one. His massive arms coming over her and ever so gently, so as not to disturb Odette from her sleep, felt for signs of the baby.

   He did not feel anything except the warm, soft flesh of Odette belly. Just as he was about to give up, he felt a soft hand press against the back of his own questing hand. Odette let out a sigh as she held his hand.


Chapter 148.


Trill.








She was thinking about pushing him away. Being disturbed from her sweet slumber by an uninvited guest, while her baby still slept in her tummy, was not a pleasant experience.

Why?

 How dare you touch it?

   She was very angry that Bastian would think it was okay to touch her without asking and impulsively grabbed his hand. As a mother, she vowed to not let her children learn submission's stance. Although her resolve was strong, she felt helpless under Bastian’s hands. 

He could subdue her with nothing more than a single hand, but still let her choose, a silent whisperS tha he'd back off if she said no.

   Odette stared out into the dark room with vacant eyes. His strong hand still rested on her belly. She could feel his heartbeat through his chest and oddly enough, it beat in time with hers. It was soothing.

   She should turn away from him, she knew that, she couldn’t sleep next to a man that had given her so much hurt, but she had given him just as much. Their animosity for each other had gone too far, how could they ever be happy with each other? It was a foolish dream she needed to let go of.

   Still, it all felt like the echo that stuck even after the piano was no longer being played. It rang in her ears and unlike the piano, it didn’t feel like it was ever going to fade.

   The warmth of his hand gently resting against her belly felt so comforting and warm. It wasn’t that she didn’t have the strength to push it away, to reject his touch, but more that she didn’t want to, she wanted that comfort.

   With her eyes closed, Odette slowly guided Bastian’s hand to the right side of her belly, where the baby was currently laying. She wanted to consider him as being unrelated to the child and her determination remained unchanged. No matter how much she tried to deny it, the fact still remained, this man was the fathers child.

Like the Da capo, back to the beginning.  She accepted that limitation and entrusted her heart to the illusion. And again, Trill. Just a little longer and it will reveal itself to be futile, no doubt. The moment will fade away and things will go back to the nightmare she was living.

   The child stirred, as if it felt the presence of its father. At the same time, a tremor ran through Bastian’s fingers. Odette guided his hand closer to the child. Nothing might have gone right, but it was still a birthday to remember. The first snow of winter, twenty four Iris’ and chocolates that made their child dance.

   In the future, should the child ever ask about their father, Odette would tell them of this day. Even though they rarely saw eye to eye, there were still a number of beautiful days like this. 'You were born in that light' ~She'd protect her child's heart, even if it meant being a dishonest mother.

As the baby stilled and the New Year’s first bell tolled, fireworks danced over the distant ocean, setting alight a grand manor's celebration.

In this final act, Odette, accepting the ending, gently unwound her grasp on Bastian.  As her fingers slipped away, the second firework blossomed, bathing the Ardennes' night canvas in a kaleidoscope of sparks.

Beneath the beautiful dance of the spectral bloom her eyes welled up by the sweet sorrow of silent tears. Bastian's warmth enveloped her hand, gently led hers back to their sleeping child. In the midst of the scintillating  fireworks illuminating the sky, their fingers wove an intimate tapestry, held close to their sleeping child, until the poetic chime of the twelfth bell.



“Hey Major Klauswitz,” a friendly voice called out.

   Bastian stopped and looked over his shoulder to see Erich Faber walking fast down the hall to catch him up. The eyes of the other officers turned to see who had disturbed the peaceful trek into work.

   “How about we walk together for the first time in a long time?” Erich said.

   Bastian waited patiently for Erich to catch up, there was still thirty minutes until the work day started, so he considered there was no reason to deny the young officer.

   They walked together through the main building of the Navy base and out onto the snow covered water garden. The paths had been completely cleared, but was still a little slippery in places.

   “You know, I found them,” Erich started as they reached the center of the garden. “Mr and Mrs Becker. They were pretty easy to track down because they had moved to a big city. The strange thing is, they were planning on opening a lumber mill, does that sound like the Becker’s to you?”

   “Yes, it sure does,” Bastian said calmly.

   Erich Faber had a lot of family and distant relatives who had immigrated to the overseas and he was the best source of information. It also helped that he had sources in the local government, so finding people was better than hiring any private detective.

‘A woman who stabbed you in the back to protect her younger sister.’

Bastian recalled Franz's cries during the fight. It made no sense to take responsibility for her sister’s sins and sacrifice everything to keep a secret. Bastian knew Odette was the kind of woman to conduct rash actions. 

There had to be something else going on. Bastian decided to trust his gut and contacted Erich right away.

   He was right to do so. The address Tira had given to Odette did not match her current residence. It might be that they are moving about, looking for the right place to settle down, to find that perfect home, but Bastian felt like it was something more.

   “Thanks, Erich,” Bastian said, pulling out a cigarette case.

   Erich helped himself to a cigarette. “She said that it was for your sister-in-law, right?”

   “Exactly,” Bastian said as he casually lit his own cigarette.

   What if Odette was some sort of scape goat? Bastian stared out at the snow covered landscape of the naval base and reflected on his memories.

   Odette’s wish was only to protect the meagre pension she got in return for acting as the princess’ shield. She would probably never have accepted the marriage proposal if it hadn’t been for Duke Dyssen’s accident. Bastian was able to consummate the marriage by exploiting her weakness and knew that fact better than any one else.

   What if Tira had caused the accident? Forcing Odette to get married against her will. If she betrayed Odette like that, then ran off to the far side of the world, then what would happen to that woman’s life?

   As he began to hope it was all Franz’s misconception, the clock tower chimed fifteen minutes to the hour. Bastian looked up at the clock and billowed smoke into the air. His fingers trembled as he put the cigarette back into his mouth.

The child, once merely a means will born, and become a real human being. He was going to be a father.

   Understanding the significance of Odette’s pregnancy left him feeling powerless. He resolved to put an end to the muddled feelings as quickly as possible, for fear of losing control.

   Bastian flicked the cigarette away and turned to make his way to Admiral Demel’s officer to offer new years greetings. Then it was off to the new years ceremony. With his perfect uniform and uptight gait, there was no evidence of the injuries he had suffered.



“Hello, I’ve come for the maid position.”

   A woman approached the gate cautiously and tapped on the glass of the guard hut. Dressed in tattered clothes and wrapped in a moth eaten scarf, the woman looked like a scarecrow.

   “Please wait a moment,” the guard said through a yawn. He fetched a clip board from under the desk and eyed it sleepily. “You’re here for the kitchen position, right?”

   “Yes, that’s right.”

   “Its not until noon, you’re early.” The guard narrowed his eyes as he looked at the clock on the wall.

   “I know. I thought I would be on time if I walked, but I guess I was faster than I thought. I don’t mean to be an inconvenience.” The young woman lowered her head in embarrassment.

   The guard clicked his tongue as he left the guard hut. The young woman held herself close against the cold and clutched her hand bag like it was a lifeline. She looked like any other country girl that had come to the city, with dreams of a fanciful life. It was most likely that the head housekeeper would reject her without further thought.

   “Well, try not to be too much of a problem, head straight for the interview, you’ll just have to wait for an hour,” the guard said, opening the gate.

   “Thank you sir, thank you very much.” The girl bowed deeply and made for the mansion.

   The guard let out a long yawn as he closed the gate again.

Chapter 149.


Tea Time.








“Take your time to choose, madam. And once you have made your choice, they will contact Ardenne mansion again.”

   Once the report was done with, Lovis signalled and the attendants waiting out in the hall approached. They presented an endless stack of brochures that showcased a wide variety of items, from the latest furniture and decoration fashions, to generic household goods. There was enough here to fill a mansion.

   Odette gazed at the brochures with some amount of confusion that she could not hide. The interior decorator had left and Bastian entrusted her with refurbishing his villa in Lausanne.

   “Has there been any messages from Countess Trier?” Odette asked calmly.

   “I can not say, it is not within my authority.” Lovis avoided answering the question directly.

   Odette sighed and turned to stare out the window. She was still forbidden from using the phone and couldn’t send any letters.

   “I have a list of servants to attend you at Lausanne. If you could give your final approval, we can reflect on it.”

   “May I have some time to think?” Odette said. Lovis nodded.

   Once the butler left, the bedroom fell into silence. Margrethe, who had water dribbling from her jowls, circled around Odette, urging her to play, but Odette remained fixated on a single spot.

   Bastian was unwilling to budge in his stubbornness. If she was not careful, she would find herself trapped in the villa in Lausanne. She desperately wanted to talk with Countess Trier, but in her current state of isolation, it was near impossible to get in touch with anyone.

"Madam, this is Lovis.I’m sorry, I forgot to give the most important thing.” 

Lovis returned, handing over the colourful catalogue. It was full of themes and ideas for decorating a nursery. As she flipped casually through the pages, barely registering the brightly coloured designs and over sized decorations, she came to a bright room of a fairy tale design. 

"Master asked for special care in designing the nursery," Lovis said gently. 

After pausing for a moment, Odette turned the page uncertainly. Her eyes deepened as she realized that she had never put any thought into decorating a nursery before now.

"Master, despite his difficulty in expressing it, I believe, harbours a special love and care for his family. I know I have no right to interfere, but I hope you will consider my master's sincerity.” Lovis pleaded as he bowed his head.


The word Family scrawled across her heart. Odette silently repeated the word to herself, a word she was unfamiliar with. Her throat welled up and formed a harsh lump. The sunlight flashed off the cover as she closed the catalogue  filled with beautiful baby items.



Molly quickly stashed the bag of ragged clothes behind the garden shed. She knew that in winter time, no one came out this way, so they were unlikely to discover her disguise. 

She straightened her maids uniform and fixed her hair which had been ruined by the pressed bonnet. She was glad she decided not to throw away her maids uniform. The rich K on the crisp apron was a detail that could not be overlooked.

   With a cold expression, Molly glared up at the mansion. That woman had ruined everything. Molly had once been filled with determination, when Odette plunged into the darkest depths of mourning. She wanted revenge without lifting a finger.It seemed unimaginable that she would be blessed with luck now.

   Is Theodora really trying to kill her?

   Molly pulled out the flask of tea from her bag. All she had to do now was exchange this for the tea Odette usually drinks and that was it. She got passed the main gate, that was the biggest obstacle, she was halfway done already.

Molly quickly grasped the situation when her aunt sought an apothecary; it was unexpected that it was a gift for Odette.

   It was funny to see Theodora Klauswitz take her anger out on her opponent, but it had nothing to do with her, she wanted her own revenge and that’s why she was doing this. It didn’t seem like a bad strategy if they wanted to destroy Odette. Bastian was blinded by a beggar princess and to be so obsessed with that woman, to try and play the hero, but in the end he was nothing more than an obviously boring guy.

   Molly had no intention of being Theodora’s servant all her life, like her aunt. She wanted one thing; the promised reward for success. It was clear who was going to win this battle and Molly didn’t want to be close to either side when the big guns came out. They were going to destroy each other and Molly wanted her money before Theodora Klauswitz went bankrupt.

   Checking her wrist watch, Molly made for the mansion across the snow covered paths. Odette had a pretty routine schedule each day. She got up in time to see Bastian off to work, had breakfast, then handled the affairs of the mansion.

   Then came tea time.



 “I mean that maid there, the one carrying the tea, don’t you think she looks a bit like Molly?” the servant said, observing a maid hurrying up the stairs.

   Dora paused in her job of checking the inventory of the pantry and looked, narrowing her eyes. She caught sight of a maid heading up the stairs. She looked flawless and neat, like she was a brand new maid.

   “I think you might have drunk too much last night,” Dora laughed. As noon approached, she checked the newly delivered ingredients and then left for a maid interview. 

“Did any of the new kitchen staff look like Molly?” 

While passing the user lounge, Dora overheard more nonsense and stared at the head cook.

"I'm talking about the maid who brought the tea caddy earlier. I heard she looks just like that girl.” 

   “Maybe, at least, similar in stature, but none look like Molly. There’s no way that snub-nosed girl is here, I think you must have been imagining things,” the cook said.

Tea was stored in a special cupboard in the pantry, always locked, and Dora is responsible for the key.

Dora felt a sense of unease, and her mood shifted to uncertainty. She meticulously inspected the bundle of keys on her belt and found that the cabinet key was still in place. Moreover, she couldn't recall seeing a maid who resembled Molly in the pantry.

So where did the maid get the tea from?

   Dora contemplated the question as she looked at the staircase the maid had ran up. Refreshments for the master and his wife was usually prepared up on the third floor, so that was the maids likely destination.

Without further hesitation, Dora rushed up the stairs.



Molly hide in a broom closet, peering out of a crack in the door as it stood ajar. Soon, a maid appeared that Molly did not recognise, to prepare the tea. It must be a new maid that was brought on after Molly left.

   Molly watched patiently from the broom closet for the maid to come out of the little side room with a tray of tea and fresh cookies. As the maid glided down the hall, Molly slipped out of the broom closet.  She had succeeded in changing the tea leaves, so all that was left to do now was sneak out of the mansion without getting caught.

   Heading back the way she had come was going to be too risky, there was a highly likely chance of running into familiar faces along the side passages, so Molly decided to head straight for the main stairs. She had just turned a corner when she saw another maid coming toward her.

   It was the maid she had shared a room with. Molly quickly turned around and heading back around the corner. The other maid had not seen her yet.

   Molly hurried back down the hall and made for the broom closet again. She would lay low in there until the coast was clear, but before she could reach for the door handle, a dog barked.

   Molly looked down as she had almost tripped over Odette’s stupid dog. It looked up at her with a pine cone in its mouth and its tail wagging furiously.

   Molly tried to shoo the dog away, but Margrethe followed her as she hurried down the hallway. There was no way she was going to be able to hide in the broom closet now. Molly grabbed the pine cone from the dog and threw it down the hall, the dog gleefully chased after it and just as Molly was about to turn and run.

   “Molly?” The familiar voice of the head maid called out to her.

   Molly ignored Dora and carried on down the hallway, keeping her head down. The stupid dog that had ruined her getaway bounded back to her with the pine cone in its mouth again.

   “Oh my god, Molly.”

   Molly decided that she could not hide herself any longer and bolted for the exit. The sound of shouts rose to a clear din and by the time Molly burst from the entrance, the bells were ringing clear and loud.

The tranquility of the mansion was shattered by the maid's frantic scream, as she called for their Madam as if struggling to catch her breath.

Molly quickly tumbled down the stairs and successfully escaped the mansion, but the emergency bell was already ringing.  It would be difficult to put the disguise back on and blend in. That’s even if they would allow anyone to head out of the gate. 

So she turned toward the forest, running at full speed, with a white dog barking fiercely and pursuing her.


Chapter 150.


The Monster's Face.

The car skidded to a halt in the front of the hospital and Bastian was out before it came to a complete stop. Lovis was there ready to greet him. His normally flawless butler’s uniform was a crumpled mess and stained with blood. 

    “I’m sorry, sir, its my fault, I was negligent…”

   “Where’s my wife,” Bastian snapped, his face looked pale. He had gotten an urgent message halfway through the new years celebration at the naval base. The soldier that had given Bastian the news looked frantic. Bastian had no thought for anything else, after getting a call about Odette's collapseand sped to the hospital as fast as he could.

   “I asked where is my wife?” Bastian said again, impatience burning up his insides.

   “Sorry, sir, she's on the third floor, in the east ward.”

   Bastian ran down the hallway, nearly knocking over a young looking nurse as he went. He didn’t care for anything but seeing Odette and making sure she was safe. It didn’t take him long to reach the east wing on the third floor. He knew which room Odette was in as the maid, Jean and Dora, was pacing in a tight circle in the hallway.

   As soon as Dora saw Bastian, she clasped her hands together as if she was praying and burst into tears. Her always neat apron was stained with blood. Bastian passed her by without so much as a look and opened the door to the room without delay. The room stank of antiseptic and disinfectant. 

Doctor Kramer was at Odette’s bedside, with a team of nurses that fussed around her. She lay on the bed, limp and unconscious. Her skin was deathly pale, and the hem of her dress was completely red.

   “Bastian,” Doctor Kramer said, seeing Bastian come into the room. “Don’t panic, everything is under control. She ingested poison, not a fatal dose and the nature of the poison has been identified and an antidote administered.”

   Bastian listened silently, then replied with a simple bow. His calm demeanor belied the fact he'd raced here upon learning of his wife's death, but his hands were trebling with fear and hatred. Poison? He clenched his fist so tight, his knuckles turned red and his nails threatened to break skin. His eyes were vacant and his lips curled into a snarl.

   Doctor Kramer turned his attention back to Odette as they were frantically doing something, then Bastian heard Doctor Kramer say something, the words rattled around his head and it took a second for him to registered what he said.

   “I think we are going to have to call it, there is no hope of saving the child.” It was difficult for Dr. Kramer to say that news out loud. “We will be able to protect Mrs. Klauswitz. We will do our best.”  The sheets were drenched in her blood by her waist as the doctors and nurses worked frantically. It had already been a long time since her water broke and the baby’s heart had stopped. 

While in a dream like daze, Bastian took a step toward his wife’s bed. He couldn’t help but notice how peaceful Odette looked. As if she was fast asleep. He tried to call her name, but his voice had been muted. He wanted to hold her blood-soaked hand, but he couldn’t even twitch a finger. It was like he was that little boy once more, confronted with his dead mother.

   All that’s left to do now is kill her. Franz’s echoing laughter rang through Bastian’s head. That’s your way of loving, isn’t it?

   The truth became a strangling snare and as his breathing became more difficult, Bastian looked up and saw his fathers face smirking back at him. 

The calm face of the monster, even after killing his wife and child.

Even after realising it was his own face reflected back at him, he continued to stare at his grim visage with pure hatred.



The sea was coloured the dazzling orange and yellow of the late afternoon sun. Molly carefully crawled out from the crevice between the rocks and looked around. It had been a long time since the search party had passed by and it seemed like she could finally make her escape.

   It is done, she could relax now. She had been chased through the woods, hoping that the side road would lead her out, but had already been blocked by the staff. Molly had no choice but to head to the sheer cliffs. One misstep would have dashed her on the rocks below.

   She got quite near the bottom when she had heard a dog barking, probably Margrethe. That damn dog had hounded her the entire time. Distracted, Molly slipped from the cliff and tumbled through the air. Luckily she was close to the bottom and only suffered a minor injury.

   Molly wiped her salty face with the crisp apron and hobbled away along the coast. It was time to collect her reward.

   Gritting her teeth against the pain, She made her way along the sandy path that ran down the coastal cliffs. It would bring her to the public beach where she was set to meet back up with Theodora Klauswitz.

Filled with hope, Molly ignored the pain in her wounded leg and hastened on. Thankfully, the rabid dog was out of sight.  It seemed the luck, which had abandoned the beggar, now was on her side.



Around the sunset, Bastian received confirmation that the baby had been pulled from its mothers womb and was dead. He could barely hear the words from the nurse, knowing full well what was going to happen, but now that it was a reality, Bastian found it hard to comprehend. Bastian, once stared at his stretching shadow, lifted his eyes to meet the nurse's. The hollow VIP lounge was now awash in a ruddy glow.

   “I am so sorry,” the nurse said, bowing her head in guilt.

   “Thank you for your hard work,” Bastian said quietly.

About 10 minutes later, the nurse left a message telling him to go to the hospital room and quietly left like a shadow. 

Bastian stood up and eyed himself in the mirror, adjusting his uniform and realigning the gleaming medals on his chest. The slight twitch in his fingers slowly stopped. After taking a sip of water to moisten his lips, he left the waiting room.

   The rhythmic sound of his footsteps echoed in the near deserted hallways of the hospital until he stood in front of Odette’s door. When he went in, the medical staff still present each offered their condolences.

   Bastian thanked them formally and approached his wife. Thankfully Odette was safe. It was only a small amount of poison and thanks to the medical staff, quickly counteracted.

   Bastian brushed the hair from her face so that he could look at her properly. He stared at her pale face for a long time.

   The maid had said that Odette barely touched her tea because she was so engrossed in the huge pile of catalogues the interior decorator had left. He knew what Odette was looking at and why. It was meant to be the first gift for their child. The child was never going to get their gift now. But Odette was save, and that was all that mattered.

   Doctor Kramer came into the room, told him about  patient's condition, doctor's opinion, future treatment plan, and  the after care treatment plan. Bastian listened and nodded his head, responding rationally even to the surprising gynecologist's advice.  Dr. Kramer, initially anxious, felt relief seeing Bastian, momentarily shaken, now as steady as always.

   “Where’s the child?” Bastian said, he wasn’t even aware that he was going to ask any questions at all.

   “There’s no need for that,” Doctor Kramer said, guessing at Bastian’s intention. “We will take care of the child.”

   “I’m the father, I have the right,” Bastian said in a calm tone. His face was expressionless, but only served to make him look even more stubborn.

   Doctor Kramer was speechless and hesitated. Bastian turned his head and looked about the room, where he spotted a medical basket just big enough to fit a very small child.

   “Please don’t do this, Major Klauswitz,” Doctor Kramer pleaded, moving to block Bastian’s path.

   Bastian politely removed Doctor Kramer’s hand from his shoulder and walked to the basket which had been covered with a white cloth. Bastian looked down at the basket and slowly pulled back the white cloth.


The calm, like a post-storm ocean's sigh, lasted until the last sunset, surrendered entirely to the inky arms of the darkness.

Chapter 151.
First-time Deviations.




“Are you satisfied now?” A voice interrupted Odette’s sleep. It had been a jarring experience, waking up and finding herself in a strange place. She stared up at the ceiling as the afternoon sunlight played on her face.

   She slowly sat up and examined her surroundings, she was in a hospital, that much was clear. There was an IV drip shoved into her arm and the place stank of sterilisation fluid and antiseptic. She tried to remember how she got there, but the last thing she could remember was drinking tea and browsing a catalogue.

   “Am I satisfied? You’re the one that’s ruined her life.”

   As Odette was trying to piece together her mind, another voice shrilled out from the corridor. There was the sound of people having an argument.

   “This is a hospital, will you please keep your voice down,” the first voice said, it was a lot calmer than the first and male.

   Two people were having a full blown argument outside her bedroom door. She knew their voices, but in her dreamy haze, she had trouble placing them.

   She got out of bed and as soon as she put weight on her legs, they buckled. Odette was quick enough to steady herself on the bed side. Instinctively she wrapped a hand around her belly and quickly noticed something was wrong. The prominent bump was missing.

   “If you had let Odette leave with me, as per the Emperor’s orders, this would never have happened,” said the first voice, a little calmer than before. It was a high pitched female voice and Odete knew who it was, but her mind was now distracted by the absence of her child.

   “If you’re going to be like this, then I suggest you head back, I don’t want you disturbing Odette,” said the second voice, Bastian.

   “You’re the one that needs to step back and accept the divorce,” the female voice said, Countess Trier.

   “I believe I already gave you my answer.”

   “How much are you willing to lose? You already lost your child due to your arrogant stubbornness.”

   Incomprehensible words poured out from both sets of voices one after the other. Odette slipped into a strange, cloudy daze as she tried to make her way across the hospital room to the door. There must have been some kind of mistake, otherwise, this was a very strange dream.

   “If this keeps going, I will have to mobilise the Imperial Guard and forcibly remove Odette from your evil clutches.”

   “Do what ever you want,” Bastian said dryly.

   “Listen carefully, Major Klauswitz, the Emperor might not be interested in being Odette’s uncle, but he will still do what ever he can to protect the honour of the royal family. Stripped of her title or not, Odette is still of royal blood and he will not suffer her miserable situation any longer, especially not if it means bringing criticism onto the family.”

   “Dear Countess, I think you might have forgotten what it was like for Odette while with her father, the Duke Dyssen.”

   “Oh, yes, sure, her life is so much better now. Constantly involved in one scandal after another. Her reputation has been tarnished, she has suffered so much hardship that she even ran away from you and now she has been poisoned and lost her child because of you. You really think all of this can be swept away with a little bit of money?”

   Bastian did not reply, the argument ended with Countess Trier’s harsh words.

   Odette stepped back from the door, the haze of clouds in her mind grew dark as a hand left the door knob she was about to turn and went to her belly. She waited for Bastian’s voice to come and correct Countess Trier, but he never spoke.

   “Baby…” Her soft, watery voice whispered, seeping into the sunlight's golden dust. Her frail hands, desperately groping the stomach, looking for traces of the child, soon lost its strength.

   Odette fell back into the room as she tried to make sense of everything. She had lost her child because she couldn’t escape him and now she may never be a mother. A crack formed in Odette’s delicate heart.

   Swallowing her tears, she ran for the window and threw it open, desperate for some fresh air to clear the mugginess from her mind. The air was cold and sharp, with the freshness of snow. 

It was bitterly cold.

An unmistakable feeling too real to be a mere dream.



Maximin had been starring into the microscope for a long time, long enough that when he finally surfaced, his eyes were sore and puffy. A knock came at the door.

   “Come in,” he said, tiredly.

   It was the curator of the Royal Botanical Garden. He had promised Maximin he would join him for tea that afternoon.

   The pair went to his office where an assistant served their tea.

   “It is an honour to have the Count Xanders for tea.”

   “Well, now that we are colleges, you can just call me Maximin,” he said with a friendly smile.

   Maximin had been cautious about accepting a role at the Royal Botanical Garden as he was worried about Alma settling in. It was fear for nothing as Alma was thriving in the rural town of Rothewein. It allowed Alma the opportunity to properly enjoy mother nature. The irritation caused by the noisy scene of Ratz was no longer interrupting their lives.

   “Very well,” said the curator. He leant over and took out a folder from his bag. “I have chosen a few places, mainly quiet villages and made up a good listings of places currently on the market, if you would care to take a look.”

   “Thank you for taking the time,” Maximin said, his eyes widening as he flicked through the folder.

   It was the only favour Maximin had asked for, when he accepted the position as head researcher at the Royal Botanical Garden. He wanted to know the quietest little village where he could relax and live. It was part of the promise he had made Countess Trier.

   “I would have thought you would already have a place, to be honest,” the curator said.

   “Yes, I already have a family villa quite near the gardens.”

   “Then this house?”

   “Some where for my relatives sister to stay,” Maximin said calmly. “She is not feeling well and needs a nice, quiet little place to stay for awhile.”

   “Ah, well then, you’ve made the best choice.” The curator then went into a tirade of all the excellent facilities available, including the hot springs that many patients had visited. Maximin listened carefully and attentively.

   Countess Trier’s plan was to first being Odette in and then finish off with the help of the Emperor. The first thing they needed was a hiding place, some where Bastian would not be able to find her. He was a man without common sense and he would not relent.

   Odette needed to get out of Ratz and someone to look out for her while the Bastian problem was taken care off, hopefully with the help of the Emperor. If Bastian was to learn of Odette’s whereabouts, he would not give up and until the divorce was finalised, Odette needed to hide.

Until the divorce proceedings concluded, Odette needed a custodian in a secure place, and Maximin happened to have the ability to fulfill that role.

“Then I’ll see you again in Rothewein.” With ardor for his hometown in his heart, the curator took his leave as the west sky began to blush with evening's touch.

   After seeing off the curator from the lab, Maximin went back to his desk and looked over the documents. A corner of one of the pages had been folded over to mark a simple stone cottage. At this point, it would do Maximin some good to be alone for awhile and it wouldn’t be so bad with Odette about.

After making a decision, Maximin strode to the desk and grasped the receiver. Countess Trier made up her mind to bring Odette home within the month after she visited the hospital. It was time for him to hurry to keep up with her.



Odette had fallen back asleep by the time the police officer came to the hospital. She had taken sleeping pills to help her fall back into a deep sleep. A maid had come to tell Bastian that the officer was waiting for him. Bastian gave up his seat to the maid and went to greet the officer.

   “I apologise for coming at this late hour, Major Klauswitz,” the officer said. “I wanted to let you know that we have found the culprit, Molly Ross.”

   “Where is she now?”

   “She is at the morgue. She was found, dead, at the sewer outlet near the Gulf of Ardenne.”

   “Was it murder?”

   “We wont know for sure until the autopsy, but its highly likely.”

   “Okay,” Bastian said flatly.

   “Do you know anyone that would want to see Mrs Klauswitz harmed? Other than Molly Ross, whom I believe Odette fired some time ago?”

   “Well,” Bastian said, thinking. “I can’t think of anyone off the top of my head, I will have to think on it some more.”

   At this point, his revenge seemed no longer valid with so much interest in them from the police. It would be difficult to hide and prison was no place he wanted to be. He had only killed a hunting dog before, so didn’t want to take the risk.

   “I don’t suppose a dog was found near the corpse?” Bastian said, probing a question.

   Margrethe had gone missing. The head maid, Dora, said she had seen Margrethe chase after Molly. Could the dog of killed Molly?

   “A dog?” the police officer said.

   “Yes, a small one, with white fur. A lace ribbon tied around its neck. My head maid informed me she saw it chase after Molly Ross.”

   “No, Major, there was no dog.”

   “Okay, well, if you find it, could you let me know.” Bastian left a polite request. “ Her name is Margrethe. You must find it. Please.”

Chapter 152.


Rotten Wound.

Odette stood at the hospital window and looked down into the hospitals backyard. She was due to be discharged and while she waited for the finalisation, she spied a young couple sat on a bench outside. It was the very same bench she had sat on during that despairing spring day when it felt like her whole world had collapsed.

   After a moment, the pair got back up. The woman had hurt her leg and the man was helping her hobble back to the hospital. It was nice to see a couple so in love like that.

   Even after the couple disappeared into the hospital, Odette continued to stare down at the vacant bench,  light's gleam on the remaining snow stung her eyes. She was still staring when Dora arrived after met the messenger from the admiralty.

   “The Master says he is very sorry he can not accompany you personally home, but he has been caught up in some very important work. He instructions to escort you to the Ratz town house, when you’re ready ma’am.”

   Bastian had returned to work a few days ago. He always left before dawn, but would return in the evening. Odette was always asleep, but Dora had informed her that Bastian would always watch over her sleeping form. Maybe it was for the better, she could only guess at how awkward it might be to have to face each other in this crisis.

Would she want to go back to him? 

She didn't know. 

Did she want to leave him? 

She was not sure of that either.

Now it seemed like it might be a good thing.  Whatever she chose, nothing will change anyway.

   Odette gingerly put on her coat. She was still not fully recovered, but the doctors said she could go home so long as she was careful not to over stimulate. It certainly felt like things could not get any worse.

   “I have a favour to ask you,” Odette said. Dora started as she was picking up Odette’s bag. She turned and gave Odette a look that made her heart sink to her stomach.


“Could you bring Meg to Ratz for me?”  A faint smile appeared on her lips, the first glimpse of human emotion she had shown since that incident. But this spectacle only added depth to the abyss of Dora's heartbreak.

   “I’m sorry madam, but…” Dora struggled to find the words to explain to Odette that Margrethe had been missing since the day she was poisoned.

   It had been ten days and the dog was nowhere to be found. Bastian had released all the servants to scour the grounds for Margrethe, but there had been no sign of her. Bastian had given strict orders not to let Odette know, but it was going to be impossible to keep it from her now.

   “What’s going on?” Odette demanded, sadness already tingeing her voice.

   “I am sorry madam, but Margrethe has been missing since the incident. Do not fret, people are constantly out looking for her and its only a matter of time.” Dora knew it was a lie not even a child would fall for, but there was nothing else she could say.

   Dora was prepared to console Odette when she cried out in anguish, hold her when she fell to her knees and bare the brunt of what ever insult she threw out in her anger, but none of that came. Odette just stood in the middle of the hospital room and stared at Dora until the dense silence takes her breath away. 

   “Okay, lets go back to Ardenne,” Odette said, her voice was as cold and clear as today's azure sky

   “B-But master said…”

   “I am going back for Margrethe, you can tell Bastian if you like.”

Odette's firm words left no room for compromise. She calmly adjusted her attire, concealing her grief for her lost beloved dog. Finally, she lowered her hat's hood ornament and departed, leaving Dora uncertain. The rhythm of her composed footsteps began to haunt the corridor.



Admiral Demel stood at the window as he smoked his cigar. Down on the main road leading into camp, officers were returning from combat swimming training out on the Prater River. Major Klauswitz leading the stragglers at the back of the group.

   Something has happened, it was clear. New rumours were already circulating and it didn’t seem like the usual nonsense, but it would be strange for anyone to remain aloof after such an incident.

   Bastian always maintained a reputation of being sincere in his duties and competent, but these days, the went too far. Although special consideration was afforded to him in light of recent events, he was still putting in the extra effort, he even gave the best time in today’s training, so he heard. Even putting in work with the family until late at night. His obsession had reached the brink of insanity.

   Still, Bastian was an ambitious person, he would have a talk with him, see if there was anything the Admiral could offer to help him along. The Emperor had gone through him to get Bastian on side with the marriage to Odette, and the Emperor was using him again, to help solve these troubled waters.

   Demel had just about finished his cigar by the time the runner came back with Major Klauswitz, who looked neatly dressed even after the intense fitness training he had just gone through.

   “I heard you were looking for me,” said Bastian.

   “Yes, come in, sit down,” Admiral Demel said and the pair sat.  The emperor, who had used him for marriage negotiations, turned to him once more to resolve this problems. Despite his displeasure, for Bastian’s future, Admiral Demel reluctantly embraced the role of the antagonist.

“I won’t take up too much of your time, Major, all I ask is that you stop being so stubborn. His majesty, the Emperor cares more about you than he does his own blood, so accept the royal decree before you make the situation worse for yourself. Can you not see that he is trying to open up a way out for you?”

   “I’m sorry, Admiral, but I think his majesty only has the reputation of the navy and its war heroes in his heart.

   “What does that matter? Is it not the same thing? Pretend for a moment that nothing you do will bring you victory. The Emperor is holding out a winning hand for you. It would be the same even if Lady Odette was not his daughter. I’m not saying you should accept his proposal right away, no doubt in doing so, the rumours would only get worse. Take a break from each other, tell the public you’re recuperating or something and once everything has died down, well. Marriage can not survive on love alone.” 

 A slight glimmer of sympathy crossed Admiral Demel's expression as he gazed at Bastian. "Time alone doesn't heal all wounds," he said. "A rotten wound has to be cut out.” 

The final counsel, given along with a deep sigh, merged with sunlight's dance.

Bastian stood firmly behind a wall of silence.



Bastian stood out the most in the conference room. There was tension so thick in the air, you could use it to strangle someone and that someone could have been any of them, as they watched Bastian go through the documents. No one dared speak, no one dared even breath too heavy. They all rolled their eyes to each other, willing, daring the other to be the first to speak.

   “How about you think over it again?” Thomas Muller finally spoke up

   Bastian froze in his examination of the paper work and fixed Thomas with a glare. Bastian reversed his decision.

   The plan to ruin his father was taking a dark turn and it felt like Bastian was not going to stop until Jeff Klauswitz was a penniless beggar. The point of the sword wasn’t just on him any more either, it was not also pointed at the Oswald’s, Theodora Klauswitz’s own family.

   “If you make even a single mistake with this…”

   “I don’t care about my reputation,” Bastian said bluntly.

   Bastian knew the world was talking about him, but he didn’t care. He didn’t care if they were right or wrong, or how close to the truth the rumours were any more. He was the Steel King, sat on his throne of blood and scrap metal.

   “All the matters is winning at any cost.” Bastian turned his attention back to the paperwork.

   The eyes of his mother and maternal grandfather were closed forever, but the blood price was still yet to be paid. Bastian planned to carry out this new mission with the utmost severity.

   The meeting rolled on well into the night. It was around the time they were covering the final agenda that a secretary came into the boardroom to deliver a message to Bastian.

   “There is a phone call from Tira Becker.”

   Bastian narrowed his eyes as he heard the girls name. Finding the Becker’s hadn’t been that difficult, but getting them to respond to his messages was a different matter and Bastian had to resort to extreme measures to get in touch with them.

   He had sent them messages and expected a reply, but nothing came. Bastian bluffed in saying that if they did not get back in touch with him soon, Mr Becker’s business might find itself in a spot of trouble. The response had been quick.

   Bastian picked up the phone in his office, “hello, Mrs Becker?”

-‘Please forgive me, Major Klauswitz, it wasn’t intentional. I tried to embroider, but my sister said I couldn’t and she asked me to keep her secret because she wanted to take responsibility for everything. So I did, you have to believe me.’ 

Tira rambled on in a frightened voice and Bastian felt sure she was crying. It seemed this phone call might take awhile.

Chapter 153.


When the Ship Sinks.


She found it as she was rummaging under the bed for a wheel of thread that had rolled away from her. Margrethe’s favourite toy, the pine cone and almost as if on cue, came the sounds of light, happy paws.

   Odette looked at the pine cone, she knew it was a trick of her mind and she wondered around the mansion with the pine cone in her hand. She was almost like a spectre come to haunt the mansion. Then, like an unwinding doll, she suddenly stopped and stared into emptiness. This was the monotonous routine of Odette's daily life, repeating day after day.

   “Madam?” A familiar voice called out from the gloom of her mind.

   It was then that Odette realised she was standing out in the frigid air, on the balcony overlooking the sea. Her hallucinations, growing increasingly indistinct, vanished amidst the crashing waves. She turned to see Dora holding out a coat for her. She quietly approached and wrapped the coat around her. 

   “Oh, thank you,” Odette said. Her dignified stance made her lost eyes stand out even more.

   “Doctor Kramer will be arriving shortly, come, lets go in and get warmed up,” Dora said, trying her best to usher Odette back inside.

   Odette had been doing her absolute best to avoid reality, as if the pain was too much Dora did her best to help Odette and felt it was probably better to endure like this, then to have oneself ripped apart by harsh emotions.

   Odette stopped staring out to sea and allowed Dora to turn her back into the warmth of the mansion.

Paying for groceries, scheduling house cleaning, and planning tonight's meal menu were all part of Odette's seemingly ordinary conversation. However, as she entered the third-floor hallway, her true, albeit not entirely concealed, emotions began to surface.

   “Has there been any reports?” Odette said dreamily, still holding the pine cone in one hand.

   “Sorry, madam, not yet.”

   Margrethe’s whereabouts were still unknown and although several sighting had come in, they were all proven to be false or of other dogs. There was even one time when a swindler came to the mansion with a completely different dog, in the hops of scamming Odette out of the reward.

   “Okay,” Odette said and drifted back toward her bedroom.

   Every day was the same. Odette would spend most of the day in her room, knitting or doing a bit of embroidery, before the pain became too much and she would wonder the mansion like a lost kitten. She would eat lunch and dinner dutifully and then fall asleep after an exhausting day chasing the memories of Margrethe. And at night, Bastian would return home to find his wife peacefully asleep.

   Dora found it hard to bare the weight of such an awful tragedy. After settling Odette into her room, she did a quick patrol of the mansion and collected the mail. She retreated to the kitchen with an armful of letters.

   There, in the kitchen, as the staff were preparing today’s evening meal, Dora sifted through the mail. It was mostly for Bastian and Odette, but oddly enough, there was a letter addressed to her.

It was letter from Countess Trier



The first thing to abandon a sinking ship are the rats. Crawling up rom their hiding places deep within the vessel, they frantically seek a means of survival. A fact Bastian was all too familiar with. In the face of the murder of Molly, Susan thought it might be her turn next. Bastian looked down at the squealing rat with calm eyes. The maid that had been his step mothers hands and feet was now knelt at his.

   It had barely been three days when Susan contacted him with the premonition. It was a better judgement than Nancy, who was unable to bring herself to her senses after her niece’s death.

   Bastian was getting bored of the woman’s begging and pleading. He looked out across the remote beach, where Susan had wanted to meet him, and he could see the two mansions, which would be blocked from view in the springtime, when the flowers bloomed.

   “I was wrong, master, please forgive me,” Susan pleased, hands clasped together as if in prayer.

   What Susan wanted was protection, and enough money to hide herself away until it was safe again. Bastian had the upper hand in this deal and although he agreed to meet up, he had not yet committed to anything.

   “I had nothing to do with the incident, I swear I did not participate in harming your wife. That was all Nancy, at Theodora Klauswitz’s behest, I swear its the truth.” Susan explained enthusiastically.

   Bastian didn’t really care. Theodora found out the truth quite by accident when she stole Duke Dyssen’s letter written to his daughter and she used Tira- her half-sister as a weapon to threaten Odette. And Odette complied with his stepmother's request to protect Tira, a choice she made not only to protect her sister but also to uphold the honor of the war hero Bastian Klauswitz.

Susan’s confession was the last piece in the puzzle that Bastian had already guessed at.

   “If you have any questions, I will answer them, anything you want,” Susan said, approaching Bastian on her knees.

   Bastian answered Susan by giving her an envelope he had been holding. Susan became flush with embarrassment as she looked in the envelope.

   “A gift for your master,” Bastian said flatly. His emotionless voice drifted away on the breeze, like the grains of sand.

   Theodora scrambled to clear away any assets linked to the botched attempt to assassinate Odette. The gangster who had murdered Molly had fled on an emigration boat and a lot of assets had been converted to cash. A saving grace for Jeff to be sure, not that Bastian cared all that much.

   Having identified the purpose behind harming Odette, Bastian saw no other way to repay the favour other than in the same manner in which she had taught him. Bringing murder charges to light or interfering with an already bedridden Franz was not going to cut it this time.

   “Who should I say the gift is from?” Susan stammers over her words.

   “Its fine, you can say its from me, there’s no harm in that,” Bastian said.

   “Please don’t make me do this, master, I’ve told you everything, please help me, please,” Susan said, sobbing now.

   Bastian felt disgust as he looked down at the pitiful heap that was Susan, but there was nothing else that could be done at this time.  He had no intention of negotiating with the person who had pushed Odette over the edgem but he needed Susan’s help to deliver Theodora’s miserable end.

   “If you do this well enough, you will have no reason to feel threatened,” Bastian said sharply. “I think it well enough that you have provided me with the weapon I need. Once done, you will be free.”

   A faint spark of hope lit up on Susan’s face as she clutched the envelope to her breast. She was a rat, rats always found a way to survive.

   As Susan scrambled to her feet and jogged from the beach, the sun was setting and stained the sky with blood. Once Susan was out of sight, Bastian turned and walked away. He lit a cigarette as he got into the car, making an impulsive decision to steer towards the road leading home.

   They were both hiding away from their realities, him and Odette. The days seemed peaceful at a glance, but Bastian knew all too well the turmoil just below the surface and he couldn’t live like this forever.

   The woman who had wanted to be crowned on a dazzling throne of gold, became a victim with a crown of thorns and fell into the abyss. The child that had been conceived by his own twisted desires was now buried in the cold earth. Bastian even had to accept defeat at not being able to find one miserable little dog.

I love you

The confession, once delayed, returned as a debt worth millions of dollars.


He now had no means left to repay any debts. Admiral Demel was right when he said he needed a way out, maybe that was the only gift he could offer Odette, but he still could not bring himself to let that woman go.

He would rather rot with her together. 

He wanted to hang on to her even if it meant hanging onto defeat.

He didn’t care that it wasn’t true love, it was okay, maybe sympathy and compassion could be bought. 

He was sure Odette will stay as she was a woman that would take responsibility and would not simply ignore the pitiful things.


The car raced down the coastal road and pulled up in front of the mansion just as Bastian was feeling terrible about himself.

   “We’re in big trouble master,”  With pale face Lovis came running to him as Bastian got out of the driver's seat. 

   “What’s the problem?”

   “I received a message from the Gardener earlier, they say they’ve found the body of a small white dog at the foot of the cliffs on the other end of the forest. Madam overheard and went to look for herself, we tried to stop her, but she…you might want to go yourself, sir.”

   Bastian swallowed, his throat was now very dry. He looked across the side of the house to the forest and imagined Odette as she came across the dead form of Margrethe. Bastian moved instinctively.

He sprinted with all his strength towards the forest bathed in a crimson sunset.


Chapter 154.


Hand Covering the Eyes.


As she got closer to the destination, she could feel her legs grow heavier until she was forced to stop. Her body had not fully recovered yet, and the short run through the forest was enough to wind Odette. Forcing herself onward, she walked at a brisk pace.

The gardener was the bearer of the news about Margrethe's discovery. He reported that while clearing dead trees in the forest, he stumbled upon a dog's body, seemingly mauled by a wild animal. Although it was not in perfect condition, the fur color and body size matched Margrethe's. Odette received this news during dinner and promptly rushed out of the mansion with Jean to where the dog's corpse lay.

   She had believe that the animal they found was not Margrethe, but just in case it was, Odette wanted to make absolutely sure for herself. 

She never saw her child, never got to say good bye. The funeral was already completed When she regained consciousness. So all she could manage to say was a heartfelt thank you to Dr. Kramer for cremating her child.

Was it a girl or a boy? 

Did they take after their father or mother in appearance?

The question that lingered on the edge of her tongue remained unspoken, swallowed down deep within. Dr. Kramer, seemingly aware that revealing the answer would be too much for Odette to bear, maintained a somber silence.

She would come to regret her decision that day, yet Odette couldn't summon the courage to inspect the wound again. And now she wouldn't be able to forgive herself if she became a coward and just let Margrethe go.

  As she got closer to the coastal cliff where the animal body had been found, Odette could hear voices. The gardeners and groundskeepers were gathered around, one was lying something out on the ground. As she come to realise what the scene meant, her vision quickly blurred with tears.

   If only she had played ball with Margrethe in the bedroom, she wouldn’t have gone out to wonder the halls and she would not have gotten herself into trouble. It was all her fault. The truth of it cut into her heart deep.

If she had reached out to Countess Trier at that moment, even if she had to force herself to do so, none of this would have happened. However, she couldn't bring herself to leave that man.

As she leafed through the pages of the nursery catalog Bastian had sent her, her hopeful dreams continued to swell. She yearned to visit the Lausanne villa and create a lovely nursery. With time passing and the anticipation of their child's arrival, she believed that things might take a turn as they lived together through a few more seasons.

Perhaps it's alright if she makes the decision later.~she thought.

   She hated herself for having such vain expectations. The foolish regret would be impossible to cut out and it would ruin everything.

   Odette suppressed the urge to turn and run, walking on with difficulty. The gardener saw Odette approach and stepped to one side to let her through. Odette could see the clearly defined shape of a small white dog, but before she could definitely define the animal, something big ran out of the forest.

   A hand covered Odette’s eyes and strong arms pulled her into an embrace, her heart pounding like it wanted to explode from her chest.

   “Odette…” Bastian said her name as a sigh.

   He took his hand from her eyes and turned her around to face him, then brought her back into an embrace. She could feel his body shaking. Odette tried to break free of his strong arms.

“Get out of my way! Let go of me!” Odette demanded, but Bastian did not relent.

   He wrapped his arms around Odette even tighter and made soothing noises to try and calm her down.  He enveloped her head and held her tightly against his chest, ensuring she couldn't turn around and gaze at the dog's lifeless body.

The servants in the forest looked at each other awkwardly, not sure what they should do and simply backed away.

   “Its not Meg, is it?” Odette said, thumping Bastian’s chest.

   Bastian could say nothing and just held her. His icy gaze fell on its ruined body, the crimson-stained white fur unmistakable even in death.

“No, Bastian. It’s not Meg, right?!” Odette pleaded, “Please say no!” 

   But Bastian could not find the words. The fleeting sunset nestled between the trees soon faded away. Nightfall began to claim the forest.

"Please, Bastian," Odette pleaded, holding onto him tightly. 

Bastian silenced her with a hug. It was the only answer he could give. 



As dusk painted the sky in purple hues, the curtain-less bedroom welcomed the evening glow. When Susan came into the study and held out the envelope, Theodora put down her tea cup and took the envelope with a quizzical look on her face.

   “It came anonymously?”

   “Yes, ma’am, it was found by the front gate of the mansion, it was brought straight to you,” Susan said with bow and walked away.

   Theodora leaned back in the sofa and opened the letter. The first thing she found was a housing document of a young woman unfamiliar to Theodora. It was an address to a small town on the very eastern fringes of the empire.

   Tossing the document onto the table, she looked into the envelope for what ever else might be inside. The next document was of Jeff Klauswitz’s borrowed name account. There was an unbelievable amount of money spread over several savings accounts. It was hard to believe he was in a position where he had to sell every asset he had to stay afloat. Amongst the names on the documents, was the name of the woman who had been on the housing document.

   Theodora tipped the remaining contents of the envelope onto the table with increasing impatience. Several photos spilled out that had been taken of Jeff Klauswitz in secret. She picked up the closest picture and studied it. Jeff Klauswitz was escorting a young woman, his arm around her waist, down some street. They were being guided by a middle aged man.

   The next photo had been taken from a different angle, clearly showing Jeff’s face, though he did not dress in Jeff’s usual manner. Ill fitted clothes that looked like they had been picked out from the gutter.

   The woman his arm was around looked as fresh as a spring daisy. A beautiful woman with a small frame and ample bosom. She looked all innocent, just like another Sophia Illis.

   Theodora looked again at the housing documents and the account details. She had been running around like a crazed woman, desperately trying to scrape together any amount of money, while Jeff was sitting pretty on a small fortune the whole time.

“Actually, I also heard some bad rumors.” Susan quietly sighed. “The master is thinking of leaving you and master Franz behind. Still, I couldn't believe it. Maybe this is a good thing?” 

   All this time, Jeff had been hoarding his fortune, probably looking for a way out of his commitment to Theodora and Franz, hooking up with a younger woman. Tears exploded onto Theodora’s face and she threw her glass of whiskey across the room. It shattered against the wall and failed to make Theodora feel any better.

K

   This had Bastian’s signature written all over it. He was the only one that would go so far as to conduct an in depth investigation, the only person that had reason to expose her. Bastian wasn’t even trying to hide it.

Her last game ended in failure. 

   Theodora accepted that fact with resignation, as she fought to end the tears. She smiled as she remembered Sophia Illis, the woman who had met a horrible end while clinging to to the man that had lost his love for her.

   In the end, Theodora was rendered down to the exact same position. Ridiculed and despised. It seemed like the junk dealers daughter had won. At least Sophia Illis left her immortal myth in the heart of the man she loved.

If this love must end, what does she mean to Jeff Klauwitz?

   Theodora pondered her role in all of this. In the end, she was nothing more than a trophy wife. A pathetic excuse that had given birth to the worst heir in history. Jeff Klauswitz would turn from them without a single regret and fall into the arms of the new Sophia Illis.

   So what should she do about it?

   Theodora stared at the documents and the photos, hearing the echo of Bastian’s victorious laughter. When she turned her head to the window, where she could see his mansion across the bay, that she realised she had achieved more than half of her success.

It didn't seem like a bad idea to do as Bastian wanted. It seemed that the child was still unaware of what lay ahead.



Even after enough time had passed to let the bath water cool, Odette did not return. Bastian had been sitting in front of the fireplace waiting. He got up quietly and went to the bathroom. When he opened the door, he was greeted with the sweet scent of soap and bubbles, Odette’s favourite.

   Odette was fast asleep in water that was perilously cold for someone in her condition. The bathwater he tested with his hand was cooler than her body temperature.  It was dangerous to leave her like this. 

   “Odette,” Bastian said softly as he grabbed her shoulder to wake her.

   Odette slowly opened her eyes and flinched when her eyes focused to see Bastian. She still looked like she was asleep, but with her eyes open. She had been like this ever since returning from the forest. Wondering around in a semi-conscious daze.

   Bastian changed his mind about calling a maid and decided to take care of Odette himself. He wrapped her shivering body up in a warm, fluffy towel and took her out of the bathroom to sit beside the fireplace, and put her on new pajamas. 

   As Bastian dried her hair, she finally spoke.

   “Its wasn’t Margrethe,” she said distantly. “It was definitely smaller than Meg and its fur was shorter too.” Her unfocused eyes took on a hint of joy.

   Once the shock had subsided, Odette was able to stir up an ounce of rationality. Although she hadn’t seen it properly, she still had the impression to go on. Bastian would have been able to tell, he would have been able to give a clear answer, but he didn’t.

   “Bastian,” Odette turned and took a seat, calling his name  with a soothing voice. The soft glow of the fireplace cast warm hues over them seated opposite each other.

Odette raised her quivering hands and cradled Bastian's face. It had been some time since she had last seen him, and he appeared much thinner than before. Her fingertips gently traced the platinum-colored hair that graced his forehead and the bridge of his nose before resting on his tightly sealed lips.

 “Will you tell me, please?” Odette sounded like a child begging their parents to tell them what they got for christmas. 


Chapter 155.


Somewhere Between Truth and Lies.


Odette’s eyes flashed with anticipation as Bastian looked her calmly. She looked desperate in her hope, which was nothing more than an attempt at clutching at straws. The hope was fragile and she felt like she was drowning.

   The more they stared at each other, the more desperate that hope became. Bastian reached up and cupped Odette’s cheek with a wet hand.

   “Bastian,” Odette said, the urge to draw closer to him was insatiable.

   Bastian thought Odette looked like an abandoned child and it reminded him of that day he proposed to her. She had been sitting all alone on the bench in the hospital garden, nestled in amongst tall roses. With a crippled father and unknown to her, a sister who had crippled him. Her face now mirrored the day she faced an unbearable reality.

Tira was the real culprit of the accident.

   It had taken Bastian a long time to come by the information, but he finally had it. The conversation over the phone went long into the night. Tira confessed everything to him. From the circumstances that led to the fight with her father, to the unexpected accident, and what happened afterward. In her exasperated desire to clear her conscience, it didn’t feel like she was making it up.

Bastian listened in silence, feeling disappointed in Tira's attempt to save herself by selling her sister, yet also empathizing with her reasons for doing so.

   Tira had been desperate to protect what she had and her new way of life. Her husband, their child and their lumber business. Her whole family’s future. It was hard to dismiss her lack of emotions when it came to her older sister, who wasn’t even a bit part in Tira’s family.

She tried to defend Odette, who had been left with no choice but to make such a decision. and when she learned of her sister's sacrifice, even covering up her wrongdoing, Tira broke down and cried. 

   Tira claimed to love her sister, but could not prioritise the love for a sister over the love of her family and her future. Perhaps it was only an ordinary affection. The abnormal one actually was Odette.

   Bastian slowly opened his mouth, but he could not say the words on his lips. If she didn’t have a sister, then she at least had a child. If she didn’t have a child, at least she had Margrethe. Odette was still continuing to wander around looking for an alter to cast herself on.

   Responsibility. Sacrifice. Dedication.

   That was all Odette’s life had become, as if it was all she could do to put meaning to her existence. She didn’t know how to live for herself. Maybe because no one had shown her how to live any differently.

   Bastian felt he could understand Odette in that moment. If you replaced family with revenge, they were the same person.

   If someone asked him why he did what he did, he wouldn’t be able to answer, but he knew no other way to lead his life. His life was pushed forward by blind inertia.

“… Yes, that’s right….It wasn’t Meg, Odette,” Bastian said, looking into her  eyes. 

The hope of Margrethe's return was painful to bear, yet that pain was the last thread that could tie Odette by his side. Bastian decided to choose the latter. He let greed steer, casting aside what was best for Odette.

   “I knew it, there was no way I wouldn’t be able to recognise Meg,” Odette said, forcing a laugh. Bastian replied with silence, stuck amid truth and lies, like in a vague fog.

The sound of firewood crumbling into ashes filled the stillness night. Relieved, Odette tried to pull away from Bastian, but at the same time, his arms came around her and held her captive against him. He held her deep in his arms and he could feel his heartbeat through his chest.

   Feeling helpless in his arms, Odette leaned against his chest, a solid wall that thundered with each beat of his heart. His hand through her hair and was unusually gentle. Odette laughed at his touch as he dried her hair.

In the wake of loss, the ashy peace morphed into unbearable ocean of sorrow—She now realized their pitiful state. They became reflective vessels, mirroring one another's pain. Vain and futile.

   It was a long time before either of them spoke again, but Odette was desperate to speak. “The baby,” she said cautiously, “Could it have been a girl? I had a feeling it might have been a girl.”

   Bastian finished drying Odette’s hair and let the damp towel fall to the floor. There was a tremble in his fingertips and it was a fight to breath normally. He had never spoken about what he had found bundled in the white cloth, the child who had died before it had the chance to grow. It was so immature, it was hard to make out any gender.

   The child always visited his dreams. Sometimes with the face of Odette, sometimes with his own face. Sometimes it was a naughty little boy, running around causing mischief, other times it was a little girl that liked to talk wildly. Often it was a simple sleeping babe in the cradle.

   The dream would always end the same, the child would be left abandoned in a field of red. At first, Bastian thought it was flowers, roses or poppies, but after the third of forth dream, he realised it was blood. There was always a strong smell of blood when he woke up.

The burden of his nightmare was his alone to bear. Bastian put a little strength into the hand around the back of Odette’s head and held her close to his chest. Once more, Odette rested her head on his shoulder, her silent sigh permeating the fabric of her gown.

   “When the spring come, we should go somewhere together,” Bastian said, gently brushing his hands over Odette’s hair.

   “Where?” Odette asked.

   “Wherever,” Bastian said, staring into the darkness.

He wanted to go somewhere far away and leave this life behind. Forget everything and start a new somewhere, where no one knew them and none of the stains of what happened marred their lives, but he would only go if Odette was there.

  “Whether its another city in a foreign country, wherever you want.”  Gently, Bastian hugged her, whispering soothing words into the night.

As sighs ebbed and flowed, darkness draped over them. Unexpectedly, Odette's head tilted, surrendering to sleep's sedative lure.

Bastian stood up, carrying her in his arms, his footsteps navigating towards their resting place. With the journey's end, the cadence of footfalls faded, plunging the room into a tranquil silence resembling the serenity of an underwater world.



Dora’s breath misted into brief existence as a white cloud of mist. She stopped when she could see the proposed meeting place, looking out for anyone skulking around.

   Countess Trier’s residence wasn’t too far from the meeting spot, neither too was Bastian. As she walked to the meeting point, the road she had taken on a daily basis to work felt utterly unfamiliar to her.

   The countess had reached out to her in helping her getting Odette away from Bastian. If he still persisted after that, then the Emperor would have to intervene directly. It would be better for everyone if Odette left quietly.

   When she had first read the letter the countess sent to her, she was furious. She had served Carl Illis and the family long before Bastian's adoption. To Dora, Bastian meant more than just a master to serve. However, she was now asked to become a traitor and betray her master but she couldn’t bring herself to destroy the letter, a part of her knew the countess was right.  Maybe at that moment, she had a premonition that such a moment would come.

   Bastian and Odette had been quietly falling apart for a long time now and she decided that she could no longer deny the truth. Bastian was a terrible husband and Odette didn’t know how to be a good wife. She was obsessed with finding her missing dog and Bastian was distracted with utterly undermining his father. They walked their personal hells alone, leaning on each other in the night, only to return to their solitude.

If things continued like this, both of them would eventually be irreparably broken.    Countess Trier asked to meet up in person in order to discuss the best means of going forward.She assured Dora that if she declined, her wishes would be fully respected.  For Odette's sake, the Countess asked her to have the courage just this once. It was a decisive plea that touched Dora's heart.

   She walked up the narrow path of the countess’ town house and rang the bell. It only took a second for the servants to answer the door.

   “Please come in, the Countess is expecting you,” said the maid courteously.

The Klauswitz family's maid crossed the threshold to become a guest of the House of Trier.

Chapter 156.


The Collapsed Altar.


Odette paused in her knitting of the lace doilies. She looked over at the dog bed beside the fireplace, littered with pine cones and a ragdoll, all of the traces of Margrethe. The auditory hallucination faded.

  Odette put down the knitting and and took the glass of water from the table. Two reports had come in that morning of a white dog that had been spotted down by the beach, but turned up nothing. Odette had gone to investigate herself. In the end, a servant found the stray dog at the shopping district entrance and it looked nothing like Margrethe.

   Later that afternoon, before the evening meal, a stranger came knocking on the door, claiming to have seen Margrethe. He even carried a lace ribbon he claimed came off the dog.

   Despite the servants' protests, Odette went to meet the man. It certainly looked like the ribbon Margrethe wore, but on closer inspection, the pattern was completely different. Odette would have recognised it immediately as she had knitted the pattern herself. The man insisted it was the right ribbon and was demanding a reward. In the end, the servants had to drag him away.

   Odette sighed and took a sip of water, in the hopes that it would wash away her thoughts, but no luck. The clock chimed midnight. It looked like Bastian would not be home until late, but she decided against getting ready for bed. She picked up her knitting needles and carried on her work.

   Before she made the first stitch, she thought she could hear a dog padding around outside again. Vexed, Odette threw down her knitting needles and ran to the balcony. She could just about make out the dark line of the beach in the moonlight and she could have sworn she saw Margrethe bounding along the sands, barking for her to come.

    This couldn’t be real, she knew, she tried desperately to convince herself it was an illusion brought on by tiredness. It didn’t make any sense. People had been scouring the beach for nearly a month to find no sign of her dog.

   Even as Odette tried to convince herself she was seeing things, Margrethe seemed ever more real. She could clearly hear the barks, the padding of feet, everything. 

It was Margrethe.

   With the certainty that she was not imagining things, Odette raced out of her room, passing through the silent corridor and stairs and reached the moonlit terrace. All the while she cried, “Meg!”

The white dog, running along the beach, barked excitedly. It was definitely Margrethe.

She had returned.

“Oh my god, Meg.”


With a hearty smile, Odette rushed down the stairs towards the sea where Margrethe was waiting for her.



Once the headlights were turned off, the mansion fell back into darkness. Bastian had left orders that no one was to greet him when he got home, but despite that, as he climbed the steps to the front door, Lovis was already waiting for him.

   “You should not be pushing yourself, sir, I worry that you will hurt yourself,” Lovis said. As a matter of course, Bastian smiled at Lovis without saying anything.

   There wasn’t much left to do and once his father was fully ruined, he would leave with Odette and would spend the rest of his life taking it easy as Lovis suggested every day for the last couple weeks.

   He had left instructions to seize his fathers assets the second he declared bankruptcy. The top priority, the lynch pin, was the railway. As soon as that fell, all his fathers other businesses would come toppling right after and his fathers empire and estate would be his. All the preparations were in place, soon, his father's jewel-Ardenne estate would be his.

   He had no idea where he was going to go with Odette, the destination had not been set, but that didn’t matter. If they couldn’t decide anywhere, then they could just travel around for a bit, until they found somewhere they both liked.

   “Sir, about the search for Margrethe, do you wish to continue with the current level?” Lovis said flatly.

   “Yes,” Bastian said.

   As the search for Margrethe went on, the number of search parties increased at Bastian’s own expense, but he didn’t care, the only thing he cared about was finding that dog.

   “But sir, it has been too long now,” Lovis said.

   “Thank you for your work today, Lovis, you may go and get some rest now.” Bastion curtly dismissed Lovis. Lovis sighed, offering no more comment and left.

   As Bastian was about to close the door, he thought he saw something in the gloom of the night. A woman in a white nightgown walked towards the crashing night sea. Her black hair fluttered in the wind, and her slender figure from behind seemed familiar. 

Bastian froze and went out into the night, believing he had seen a ghost. He raced after the wispy thin figure, chasing it down to the beach where it plunged into the sea without thought for the oncoming waves.

   “ODETTE!!” Bastian shouted as he ran like a hunting beast that had been unleashed toward her.

 “ODETTE!”

   He sprinted down the beach, tossing aside his jacket, his tie, his shirt and his shoes. He  jumped into the sea and called to her constantly, but Odette never acknowledged that she could hear him, she pressed on into the waves, the water coming up to her waist.



It wasn’t Margrethe. Odette realised this only when the sea water reached her shoulders and splashed her face with salty brine. It was a deflated little ball, it almost seemed to glow white as it was surrounded by the dark waters.

   A rueful smile played across her lips as she watched the ball drift away on the currents. She had done something entirely stupid and the reality of it reached her grieving mind as the sea water lapped against her chin.

   “ODETTE!” someone called out from the darkness.

   Odette turned back to the shore and could just about make out a tall, thin figure fighting against the tide to reach her. Bastian. Just as she was about to call back to him, a wave smashed into her and the current swept her away. She could no longer feel the bottom and sea water rushed into her mouth.

   Flailing frantically to keep herself above the surface, everything became dark and a terrible pressure about her person prevented her from being able to breath. Just as she was going to reside herself to being drowned at sea, a firm hand grabbed her arm and dragged her away.

   Odette was brought up to float on her back, the moon, bright in the sky, looked as if it was laughing at her. She drifted with the waves toward the shore, being dragged along by Bastian.

   Odette clung to her only beacon of salvation with all her strength. Even though Bastian was panting from the effort, he did not stop and they quickly found themselves back at shore.

   She felt her body become weightless as he carried her out of the water and laid her to rest on the soft sand. The breath that flowed from her lips returned the warmth the sea had stolen. Coughing, she opened her eyes to find a pair of blue eyes, like flickering cold flames, staring at her.

   “Bastian…” Uttering his name in a faint whisper, Odette tried to get to sit up. Only then did Bastian let out a groan, like the cry of a wounded beast, and sat in the sand next to her.

"It's not like that," Odette urgently explained, gazing at Bastian's pained and angry expression. "I didn't mean it that way…I-I thought I saw Meg,” she said, feeling like a little girl that was about to face punishment for doing something very naughty.

Bastian wiped his wet face with a bitter laugh, struggling to catch his breath. She wasn't lying. The moment their eyes met, he realized it. 

She jumped into the sea to find Margrethe. Maybe was using Margrethe as an excuse to escape the pain. Her pathological obsession wasn’t just about the dog, but the pain he always caused her. She was trying to escape one pain, only to replace it with another, using self-harm as a means to escape.

That pain was the last thread that tied her to him and he knew that fact very well. He never realised it before, but that pain was going to kill her someday.

He lifted his reddened eyes, bestowing it upon the ethereal spectacle of the sea as it basked under the luminescent quilt of moonlight. His gaze sailed on silver waves to the shore, reached the breaking foam, and returned to Odette once more.

   “It’s true, Bastian,” Odette repeated her innocence, her turquoise eyes were like a paradise sea he wanted to dwell in forever. He beheld her terrifying beauty, his grasp filled with a silvery fistful of sand.

“She was right there.”

   “Meg is dead, Odette,” Bastian finally said in a whisper so soft, Odette wasn’t sure she had heard him.

   “Don’t do this,” Odette said, tears coming to her eyes. “You clearly said it wasn't Meg. You saw... … .” 

““I lied. I thought this way you wouldn’t be able to leave me without Meg,” Bastian said, looking at Odette.

   “...No…” Odette snapped. She jumped to her feet and looked as if she was about to run, Bastian stood and grabbed her arm before she could. “Let me go! No, no, no!”

   Odette thrashed wildly, like prey cornered. Bastian grabbed her chin firmly and forced her to look at him.

   “Get a hold of yourself and listen, Odette,” Bastian said, his voice devoid of emotion, cold as the night sea that had swallowed her.

 “The child is gone! Margrethe is gone too.” He unceremoniously destroyed her last remaining altar, everything Odette ever clung onto.

The hollow eyes of the sacrificial lamb, with no place for the blood to spill, soon blazed with furious rage. Bastian stood boldly before her, waiting for the storm to break.


Chapter 157.
The Windless Sea.


  “IT’S BECAUSE OF YOU!” she exploded like a gun and drowned out the crashing waves. The once pale cheeks were now practically glowing red, flush with hot anger. The streaks of tears on her puffy cheeks flashed in the moonlight.

   Bastian had been waiting for this moment, the moment when she would finally break. Whatever she was before this moment would be lost forever. He swallowed the passion welling up inside, forming a lump in his throat and let go of her.

   “YOU KILLED MY BABY, YOU KILLED MY MARGRETHE!” Odette continued raving.

   The resentment that she had been holding back over the years was now boiling over in a spectacular display of raw emotion. She knew it was an unfair judgement, but it wasn’t entirely wrong. A voice in the back of her mind was telling her to calm down, pleaded with her to stop and see reason, but Bastian’s silence infuriated her even more.

   “You’re so damn arrogant you think you can ignore the Emperors direct orders!” Odette ranted, her hands formed tiny little fists that she waved at him. “If you had just let me leave with Countess Trier, the baby, the dog, they would both be alive and well. Why didn’t you let me go? Why didn’t you say anything? Why did you deceive me? TELL ME!”

   Odette screamed, she shouted at the top of her lungs, her voice carried across the sea and drowned out even the noise of the ocean. Bastian still just stood on the beach and watched her.

   “You should have left me alone in Felia. No matter how poor I was, it would be better than now.” Flashes of memories came to her, of her brief and simple life. They, too, were drowned out by her white hot anger.

   Odette turned to face the sea, to where her baby, her dog was washed away with the tide. When she turned back, all that was left was him. Her salvation and her despair. Her another source of sadness and pain. A person so pitted with hatred and drove her crazy because she can't let go of him.

   “You should have deceived me until the end!” Odette realised right at the end, as she let the anger well up deep in her heart. The base truth hidden behind the belief that Margrethe would return. She felt like such a fool.

   She wanted to protect what she had, even if it meant staying with him. She hated herself for feeling that and she hated Bastian even more for letting her know.

   “Why did you save me if you were just going to do this to me?” Her weak, aimless punches thudded against Bastian’s chest. “SAY SOMETHING, ANSWER ME!”

   Odette gasped for air, her heart pounding so hard in her ears as she struggled to regain her composure. Bastian hugged her deeply into his arms, gently stroked her back. The empty look in her eyes slowly began to fill with emotions once more. Tears welled up, but she held them back as if she was done with drowning in her own tears. Bastian, too, seemed equally overwhelmed.

She raised a trembling hand to his cheek. His face was like the calm sea where no wind touched it, but his eyes were a storm. The silence hung heavy around them, their lips sealed shut, but their tear filled eyes spoke volumes.

   It was all that she needed to tell her that she had wounded this man as much as he had wounded her.

   In the stillness of the moment, she pictured the days ahead of them. Days where they would constantly fight to wound the other. Where the shattered remains of their emotions would form jagged edges with which to cut. Like warriors trapped within the debris of their own destruction.

   Her lips parted, but she didn’t dare utter a word. She couldn’t apologise and neither could she accuse him. The reality chocked her and she struggled for breath.

   Bastian touched her cheek with gentle fingers and their eyes met as she looked up. She felt shame and tried to turn away, unable to endure the weight of his accusing gaze, but he held her firm in his warm hand.

Their eyes locked. As she started to look away, his hand gripped hers tighter, a warmth spreading.

   “I feel pain whenever I look at you,” she confessed, her words coming as quiet as the dawn.

   “I know,” he said. 

   “You feel that too.”

"I know." He painfully held onto her even while giving her a painful answer.

Unable to look at him, Odette shut her eyes. It was her only escape in this torment.



All the servants were gathered around in the lounge, sitting around the central table, looking at the chef, who was being very loud. “He knows better, the heartless bastard,” she bellowed, not caring who heard, “Madam loved Margrethe, he is well aware of that, but he still won't make a grave for that poor thing?”

   The chef clicked her tongue in disgust. She was normally one of the most loyal supporters of Bastian, but this had crossed a line. The other servants seized on the opportunity to voice their own opinions and the lounge devolved into a din of chorused voices.

   Dora remained silent, sipping on her tea. She understood their perspectives well enough, but this time she found it impossible to defend Bastian.

   The dog the gardener had found was indeed Margrethe. What shocked Dora more was Bastian’s reaction. He left the dog for the gardener to deal with and proceeded to lie to Odette about what they had found. The gardener, with no instructions to bury the dog, instead cremated it with the rest of the trash. Needless to say, the staff were outraged.

   “Why hasn’t the missing posters been taken down yet? There was another claiming to have Margrethe today,” the laundry maid said.

   “It's not that easy, there were thousands of posters put up, its going to take time to bring them all down again,” said the chef.

   They continued to vent their frustrations until the clock chimed and Dora was reminded of the passing of the time. Every shuffled back to their duties, while Dora headed for Odette’s room to discuss dinner plans. She knew Odette would probably not have a proper meal, but she needed to eat something.

   Dora took a breath before she knocked. “Yes? Come in,” Odette’s soft voice called. Dora entered the room and found Odette as composed as ever.

   Odette was sitting in the chair by the window, wistfully staring down to the bottom of the garden. Where she had been sat yesterday, and the day before that, and before that too. Dora knew she was looking down to the memorial grave at the bottom of the garden.

   Dora felt a little relief that Odette would not be chasing around the forest or the beach any more. It was small comfort though. At least now, Odette could try to move on.

   “Major Klauswitz will be late home again this evening,” Dora said.

   Odette turned to look at Dora, her face as sad and pale as ever. “Alright, I will have dinner in here then,” she said with a ghost of a smile. “Is there any other business?”

   Before Dora answered, she noticed a sternness to Odette that wasn’t there before. Her cold composure was a lot more rigid. There was a change in Odette that made Dora think that she has somehow found her strength in all of this.

   This is my last chance.

   Dora decided to take that chance. She stepped toward Odette. The silence remained as Odette waited for Dora’s response, her eyes questioning Dora as she approached. This was going to be Dora’s last chance. She slipped out a letter from her pocket and offered it to Odette.

   It was a letter from Countess Trier. The date set by the Countess was just ten days away, but she held onto it in the hopes that Bastian would make the right decision on his own, but he didn’t. Bastian would never let go. No matter how much he caused this poor girl to suffer, he would not let her go. So the only hope now was this letter.

   “Please, take it,” Dora said. Odette accepted the letter without much thought.

   As Odette opened the letter, Dora could feel the tension get drawn like a bowstring. As Odette read the letter, Dora’s heart thundered. As Odette looked up at Dora, she felt her nerves wind so tight, her mind went fuzzy.

   Odette never said a word. She just looked at Dora almost as composed as when she first entered the room. There was a little confusion on her face.

   “You’ve worked hard enough, ma’am, now its time you got to decide.” Dora’s voice filled her head and she felt sure she was going to collapse. “I will follow your will.”


Odette remained silent as Dora prepared to exit the room, her silence lasting until Dora finally left.


Chapter 158.
Winter's Fading Embrace.



“Why are we still doing this? This work is a fruitless waste of time." Keller’s assistant said. He had made that same complaint everyday. Keller smiled indifferently and accepted the camera his assistant held out to him.

   “I think you’ve forgotten how much we are earning from this little job,” Keller said smugly.

   “Pah, forget the money, I wanted to learn a trade. I didn’t become a detective just to spy on Countess Trier all the time.”

   “Quit your belly aching and follow me.” Keller walked off toward the storage cupboard at the corner of the office. It was used as a darkroom for processing photographs.

   Keller immediately set to work on the film in the camera. There was a lot of film today, so the work took longer than usual, which meant Keller had to put up with more of the complaints from his assistant. He wasn’t entirely wrong, but he was getting paid, so he let it slide.

   They had been at it for the last two months and in those two months they had found nothing. They kept a log of all the visitors and all the places the Countess Visited. They only place they couldn’t get a look in on was the Imperial Palace.

   “Major Klauswitz must have forgotten about us, seeing as he hasn’t ever asked us for results yet. Why don’t you check in on him?” the assistant said, shuffling a deck of cards.

   After thinking for a moment, Keller nodded. “Alright, I’ll make a call later.”

   Keller had long since come to realise that this investigation was pointless, but without any specific instructions from his employer, he was resolute to carry on his work. He would have to check in at some point, though, he couldn’t keep freeloading without expecting the Major to get funny about it.

   Eventually the photos were dry. Keller knew deep down he wasn’t going to find anything and as he gazed deeply into the last photo, he was proven absolutely right. The last picture was of some woman leaving Countess Trier’s residence. Probably some work relation or an acquaintance from one of the many tea shops the Countess likes to visit.

   The woman in the photo was dressed moderately enough to frequent such places. There was nothing really remarkable about her, but something caught Keller’s attention as he was about to throw the photo onto the discard pile.

   He took the photo out into the bright light and worked his magnifying glass over it. It was definitely her, the head maid of the Klauswitz household. Keller had a gut feeling this wasn’t something to passed over and he went to pick up the phone. Had a second thought. Then reached for his hat and coat.

Keller rushed out of the office with the photo and a brief note in hand. Close by, the naval headquarters, adorned with a trident symbol representing the sea god's power, glowed brilliantly.



Odette stood on the balcony and looked out over the sea. It was still bitterly cold, but the warm sunshine on her face was a herald to spring. The gentle sea breeze played with the hem of her dress as she watched the waves.

   Centred, Odette went back into the room and continued packing. There wasn’t really much to do, as most of it had been sorted through last autumn. There were some odds and ends the pawnshops never wanted, several items of clothing and some mementos. Unlike when she ran away, this had a definitive feeling of completion to it.

She packed a few outfits and prepared to leave. Breathing in the breeze from the open window, she scanned the room filled with her past life. Feeling more at ease than during her rushed escape, it seemed like she had no more burden on her heart to end everything.

   The date set by the Countess was only a week away, where she was to meet the Countess’ acquaintance in the park, behind Ardennes City Hall. Dora would help her, of course and from there, only the Countess knew the travel plans. Odette didn’t know where she was going, she didn’t even know who this acquaintance was going to be.

   It might be a reckless gamble, but Odette didn’t care any more, she was willing to take any risk, accept any helping hand that would get her out of here.

   Odette pulled the rope for the service bell and went back out onto the balcony again, to watch the sea.

   Mother, Father, Tira, Margrethe and the baby.

   As the memories of everything she had lost flickered through her mind, her heart felt emptier until there was nothing left. Odette felt like she understood something. She had been an empty shell her whole life.

   “Ma'am, it's Dora,” Odette heard the maid call from the room when she combed through her tousled hair and smoothed out her skirt.

   She left the terrace, closed the window then went back into the room, where Dora was stood by the door, patiently waiting for her. She was looking about at all the empty boxes and half packed clothes.

   “Are you sure you will be alright?” Dora said. There was an open box that contained all of Margrethe’s things.

   “If you wouldn’t mind taking that box to the incinerator,” Odette said, pointing at the box.

   “Yes, ma’am, I will take care of it,” Dora said, trying not to sound emotional.

   “Is that letter for me?” Odette said, noticing it in Dora’s hand.

   “Ah, yes ma’am, its from Countess Trier.” Dora handed over the letter. 

The conversation after that was businesslike. 

Dora calmly updated Odette on the incident's progress while she read a letter she'd received.  At a glance, the scene could have been mistaken for an ordinary afternoon during which they discussed household tasks.

After Dora left with the box, deep silence returned. Odette read through the letter several times, before tearing it into small pieces and chucked them onto the fire.

   The Countess wrote that the divorce would be settled quietly. Bastian would come to no harm, maintaining his honour. The Emperor had also conveyed his respects for Odette wanting to distance herself from the royal family.

   Odette moved to a window that overlooked the garden, where she could see Margrethe’s memorial. She watched as Dora came into the garden and moved around to the incinerator, disappearing under the house.

   Everything was ready. All she had to do now was act convincingly enough in front of Bastian.



Bastian ran around the perimeter of the Admiralty, then circled into a garden that still had the last of the winters snow covering most of the greenery. Despite the distance, he showed no signs of fatigue.

   Coming out of the garden, he walked around the parade ground, allowing himself chance to catch his breath before he got to the gym. Where he would be half way done with his physical training session.

   Drinking nearly a full bottle of water, he quickly stretched before loading up the barbells. The physio regime the doctors set had him working without any weight, but Bastian found it a waste of time. He loaded the barbell with a little less weight than he usual did, but he found the pain some what comforting. Focusing on it, he could shut out the world.

   It have him chance to think about what Keller had showed him. A photo, just the one and a short note. He quickly grasped the situation. But as the bell rang for physical training, his thoughts ceased.

   “Bastian,” someone called just as Bastian finished his rep. Lucas called to him from the entrance. “Let's go, time's up.”

   “You go,” Bastian called back. “I’m not done yet.” This was his last appointment of the day, so it didn’t matter if he overran.

   Lucas said something back, but Bastian was already zoned out, concentrating on his next exercise. By the time he finished his workout, the gym was empty. Bastian lay out on the mat, drenched in sweat, staring up at the ceiling.

   It was the head maid. Even without Keller pointing it out in his over overdramatised way, Bastian knew who it was. It was the face of a woman he had known for twenty years. There was only conclusion for her meeting with Countess Trier, 

Odette.

   Bastian stood and made his way to the showers. As he let the water pour over his sweaty body, the last of the sunlight faded away. After the shower, Bastian made his way to his office in Ratz.

   The company building shone brightly like a lighthouse and as he went up to his office, the secretary chased after him, feeding him updates, the most important of which was news from the original family.

   Getting to his office, Bastian lit a cigarette and picked up the phone, dialling for Keller, who answered after a single ring.

-Yes, this is Keller.

   “It’s Bastian, the missions changed.”

The voice, laden with smoky depth, was as dark as the night beyond the window.


Chapter 159.
Curtain Call.


“The master will be returning home early, this evening, and has left instructions to prepare a formal dinner,” Dora said to her.

   Odette nodded and began tidying away all her sewing materials. The lace she had worked on for most of the day had taken on a life of its own, not looking anything like the pattern she was attempting to follow. The back was so tangled with loose thread, it would take a huge amount of effort to unpick it all and start again.

   “I could let the master know you’re not feeling well,” Dora said, looking to provide her with a way out.

   “No, there’s no need,” Odette said calmly. “I’m fine.”

   Over the last week Bastian had changed his usual routine. He was coming home earlier each evening and had dinner with her who couldn’t find anything of note to have warranted such a change. It didn’t matter to her, after today, she wouldn’t need to act out her part.

   “Very well,” Dora said with a bow and left.

   Odette made ready for the evening. While one maid filled her bath, she and another maid picked out a dresses for the evening. They were laid out on the bed, their vibrant colours and patterns looked like a field of wild flowers. There were matching shoes and accessories. It seemed overly extravagant for a simple evening meal.

   This time tomorrow, she would be leaving and this time, hopefully, for good. Odette’s mood lightened a little at this realisation.

She steeled his anxious heart countless times, and now the moment was here. If she retreated now, she would rest in tomb-like peace forever.

What should she fill her emptiness with? Finding the answer was tough, but one thing was clear: she wouldn't surrender to sorrow and pain, leaving only one option.

   Odette stepped toward the bed and listened to the advice of the maids who were preparing her outfits, with much contemplation, she chose a blue, silk dress and a diamond necklace. It was her first proactive choice in a week.

   The maids, encouraged by the sudden change in their mistress, bustled around her. From the bedroom to the bathroom and back again, the bustled around Odette like a small swarm of very energetic bees. Sunset drew nearer.

   The sound of the comb gliding through her hair filled her ears. She felt like foolish woman who had allowed herself to be trampled on too many times. She couldn’t let go of her regrets as she prepared for the evening.

   Odette looked at herself in the mirror of her vanity. She barely recognised the girl that looked back at her. It was so easy for her to play the roll of a downtrodden woman, someone who had known nothing but unhappiness through foolish love.

   Bastian had become more like the sea of Ardenne in the spring time. Cool and gentle, deep and tranquil. He lingered at a distance from her, no longer rushing at her nor retreating from her. She felt it was impossible for him to realise he was being deceived so long as he kept that distance.

   So what was the reason for the change in his behaviour? The thought came unbidden to her mind, but she tried not to linger on it.

   So long as Odette didn’t do anything to arouse suspicion, then that should be enough. Odette concluded that any further judgement was a waste of her thoughts.

   Just as the maid finished braiding Odette’s hair, Dora came into the room. “The master has returned,” she said, she sounded excited.

   Ignoring the maid trying to tie off one last braid, Odette got up and moved to look out the window. A cream coloured car, with gold wheels, approached the driveway.

   Odette turned back to the mirror for one last look at herself and after rearranging a stray strand of hair, adjusted the sit of her jewellery, she strode from the bedroom as graceful as any swan.

The final night had arrived.

   It was time for the curtain call.



Dinner started earlier this evening.

   Bastian pulled out a chair for Odette then took his own seat at the table. Lovis came out with the appetizers and informed them that the main course would be ready shortly.

   “Take your time, Lovis, we’re not in any rush,” Bastian said.

   He had returned from his meeting with Admiral Demel, and the Joint Chiefs, a lot earlier than expected, so was well prepared for dinner not being ready quite yet.

   “Yes, do not rush on our account,” Odette added with a soft smile. Her smiled looked refreshed, like a splendid jewel.

   Bastian slowly sipped his aperitif as he looked at her, but Odette was catching the last of the landscape before the sun set fully and darkness blanketed the landscape. When she looked back, their eyes met across the table. Odette smiled shyly, her cheeks going red as she averted her gaze to the appetiser in front of her.

   She was a woman that shone most beautifully when she told a lie. Bastian swallowed his wine with a sense of emptiness that came with that fact. It was so obvious what Countess Trier was planning when she recruited Dora to her cause. It had to be about Odette and now that the tail had been caught, it was time to dock it.

   At least, that was what Bastian had intended until he received news while in the meeting with the Joint Chiefs. Theodora Klauswitz was seeking to cultivate all of Jeff’s hidden assets and flee abroad. He knew she was fleeing because she bought a single, one way, ticket to a far off land. She was acting exactly as Bastian predicted.

   But how do I protect Odette from the fallout? He asked himself as he watched Odette carefully take the food from her fork.

   Noticing him looking at her, Odette fixed him with a hard stare. “How long do you plan on disobeying the Emperor?” she said flatly.

Bastian glanced at her and ate silently. Odette easily understood his response through his quiet demeanor.

"You accomplished all of this through great effort." Odette surveyed the opulent banquet hall, focusing on the hero's honor symbolized by a brilliant medallion.

   Only after escaping from their spiral into the abyss, were they able to finally see the reality for what it was, what they had lost because of each other and what they might continue to lose, but it wasn’t too late.

   Even though he had been ostracised for his behaviour, Bastian was still in a strong position. He was the Emperor’s favourite war hero, a successful capitalist that kept getting richer each day and after sorting out this marriage, he would be able to recover his honour and reputation.

   So maybe they could still have a good farewell.

She harboured this hope cautiously and waited for his answer, and with the arrival of the night's darkness, Bastian finally turned his gaze back to Odette after a considerable wait.

   “How about we leave Ardenne first,” Bastian said.

   “What’s going on, Bastian?” Odette said.

   “Nothing,” Bastian said calmly.

   There was a note of hesitation in his voice and a forced smile on his lips. She got a sense of his true feelings through those small cracks in Bastian’s otherwise smooth and cool persona.

 Odette was able to act the part and fool most of the world, but her acting was noticeably clumsy and lacking in experience. After being deceived by her numerous times, Bastian knew he needed to become a much better actor. So he can deceive the woman who was trying to deceive him, and thus deceive himself.

   “Look, living in this mansion will only make your heart suffer. Go to Lausanne or another place with villas, if you can’t handle being here any more, then why don’t you go on ahead of me. I will meet you later, once I have cleared up the work that still needs doing here.” Calmly, Bastian filled his empty wine glass and said.

   He would do anything to protect Odette, that belief was as resolute and as strong as ever, but he had his limits. Recent defeats taught him that and left him feeling inadequate to protect her. If he were to continue making these mistakes, he would lose Odette forever.

   Realising this, Bastian changed Keller’s mission. He had objected, of course, but it was time to bring these investigations to their natural conclusion. He simply could not let her go and he certainly could not bring himself to send her away,  even though he knew everything.

So, he decided to close his eyes, biding his time until they could return to square one. He was willing to be deceived if it meant protecting her, yet, his foolish heart continued to harbor thoughts of revenge.

   He wished he could take her away from all of this, run away and never look back, start again. He was her husband and she his wife. If they could only live in such a place where it was only them two, maybe then they would be able to forgive each other and start over. Lead a relationship of love and compassion for each other. Yes.... if only your heart was the same as mine.

   “Yes, I think that would be nice,” Odette said.

   In the moment where that quaint hope felt absurd, Odette agreed with him. Her eyes shone in the candlelight, and her lips drew into the gentle curve of a smile.

   Bastian mocked her smile with his own and stared at Odette, who seemed to have regained her original skills of deception. Seeing her behave like this made Bastian feel like he had already pushed her too far, but perhaps tomorrow, something might change. The lingering remnants of feelings he hadn't entirely let go of clouded his judgment. 

He lingered on the illusion for a little longer, wishing above all else that it could last. 

His gaze remained fixed on her beautiful face, where her fake smile concealed her truthful  eyes.

Chapter 160.
Fine.


Bastian didn’t go to bed until late that night. It felt like he still had a lot of work to do. Odette was tossing and turning, unable to sleep, until she gave up trying to get to sleep. 

The midnight chimes began to ring.The last day had finally come. Odette wrapped herself in a shawl and went to linger by the window for a moment, trying to calm her nerves as she kept thinking about her last day here. 

Eventually, she left her bedroom and walked along the darkened corridors, down the stairs and stopped only when she saw light pouring out from under the study door.

   Bastian had returned from work early, had dinner with her, but still stayed up late, working in his study. Phone calls and letters came through the mansion quite regularly, as if the business had relocated to the mansion.

   Despite everything, he had made some time to be with her and she understood what time meant to him. She was grateful for the effort, but ultimately, she felt sorry for him, for the days that had passed them by and put an ever greater strain on their relationship.

   She stared at the light seeping from the study thankful for his help, her eyes filled with gratitude for his efforts even though she could not repay him.  In the end, their shared days, however, made their lives more miserable.

Now it was finally coming to its end. It was over. 

Odette turned away from the study's light, her hurried footsteps blending into the quiet darkness. She didn’t want to return to her bedroom, to fidget uncontrollably in restlessness, so she wondered around the mansion, thinking back to all the days that had passed. 

She ended in the solarium at the end of the hallway. Moonlight draped the glass room in ethereal beauty. Aloft in the sky, the moon caressed the sea, taming the night's obsidian heart.

   There was a grand piano to one side of the room, sheet music still on the stand, waiting to be played, so Odette sat on its bench. She caressed the keys, as if bidding them farewell and she started to play.

   The soft tinkle of music echoed through the still mansion, soft and melodious. After a few chords, Odette smiled and then she noticed a shadow moving into the room. It was Bastian, he had come.

  As she noticed him, she withdrew her hands from the ivory keys. Bastian did not move from the doorway. He did not approach, nor did he retreat, just like he had done all week. Quietly watching her from a safe distance.

   Why had he come?

   The question emerged from the corner of her mind and lingered there. The midnight hour deepened as she sat there, waiting to see what Bastian would do.

   He said the divorce would be handled by his attorneys at the appropriate time, so unless something happened, they would not meet again after tonight. Even realising that, she said nothing and placed her hands back on the keys to play the next note of the Fantasia where she had stopped. 

Then, note by note, her fingers danced and the tuts chimed. As chords intertwined, a harmonious tune unfurled. Gracefully, she played the piano, recapturing the original tempo and rhythm as the slow, steady notes melded into a single melody.



The music was rich and filled the moonlit night like a dream. The very melody that had led him to the solarium. He stood at the door and listened to her play, not daring to disturb her. He had initially thought the sound of music coming into his study was some kind of illusion brought about by tiredness.

   When he followed it, though, the scene became surreal. Odette, who would usually be asleep by now, sat in the moonlight and played.

  Even seeing it with his own eyes, it didn’t seem real. The melody echoed about him, drawing him in and he hummed along softly. He leaned against the door frame and closed his eyes. It didn’t matter if it was a dream, he would remember it for a long time either way.

He had never before poured his heart into music, yet its beauty undying.

   He hoped that the performance would never stop, as the sweet melancholy of the piece washed over him like a soothing wave. 

A trill filled the air, a sound signifying the effort to prolong this beautiful moment.



Da capo, back to the beginning.

Odette followed the path of the music, sending out the notes of sound that blended into perfect harmony, and returned to the beginning of the piece. 

And again, trill. 

She found herself turning back the clock in her mind, amidst the richer melody of Fantasia, thinking about days before irreversible wounds had been inflicted and suffered.

   Memories swam through her head, to the days of false compassion as she played her part in a relationship she would learn to resent. To when she had not received just one proposal, but another that came on a fine spring day, when the flowers were in full bloom.

   Mostly her memories lingered on that first fateful night, when she lifted her dark veil with trembling hands. It was the first out of place button in a relationship that was just wrong. If only she could go back to those days, knowing what she knew now, she would have made different choices. 

Her performance reached its climax. She imagined an officer and a lady, who met under normal circumstances and found themselves naturally attracted to one another. No matter how she imagined it going, it still felt wrong from the very beginning. There was no room for happy memories in both Bastian’s and her life.  It was just never meant to be for them.

   It was then that Odette understood that their lives would have been much better if they had never met in the first place.

Odette played another trill, reversing time on the painstakingly restored memories. As time's current regained its original flow, it surged and swirled, dispelling the thoughts that had troubled her mind.

The end of the melody came and once more. She started over and started to imagine things if she had never met him, what she might have become, what she might have done. She couldn’t relive the past, but they had the power to take control of their future.

 It was time to let go.

 It was the best ending they could hope for. 

To go their separate ways and live their lives away from each other.

   Odette closed her eyes as she played the last melody. Without much thought to it, she wavered from the written music and started to play her own chords, up until the finally note, where it lingered in the darkness of the solarium like a fading memory.

   Without meaning to, Odette opened her eyes and looked over to the door, where the shadow shifted and moved away back down the corridor, away from her. The solarium descended into peaceful silence once more.

Once the sound had faded, Odette lifted her fingers from the keys and gently closed the piano lid.



Bastian awoke just as the first rays of dawn spread out from the horizon. Habitually he looked at the time, then rolled his head to look at Odette next to him. She was asleep and looked peaceful.

   As the minutes passed, the light became brighter and lit up the room. The reality that he would have to get up became a more prominent thought until the restlessness was too much and Bastian sat up in bed, ready to start the day. Despite having only slept an hour or so, he was not feeling all that tired.

   When he stood up, he made sure the blankets were put back over Odette’s shoulders, who grumbled a little and buried herself deeper into the snug bed. He went back to his room to get ready for the day and as he was standing under the stream of hot water, the melody from last night came back to him.

   Bastian took a longer shower than usual, thinking about the music that Odette had played. By the time he shut off the water, his skin was brilliant red and his fingertips were wrinkled. He shook the fug from his mind and continued to get ready.

   He spent a little more time than usual shaving, sorting his hair and making sure every detail was exact.

   A knock came from the bedroom door. “Master, its Lovis.”

   “Come in,” Bastian said, adjusting his shirt hem snugly against his belt. He meticulously examined every detail of his uniform, from the creases to the epaulettes and the alignment of his medals, striving for perfection. As he scrutinized his attire, the moment to leave Ardenne drew near.

   “Master, the car is ready, its almost time,” Lovis said as he came into the room. He looked some what perplexed when he saw that Bastian was still not ready.

   Bastian adjusted his tie. He had to leave Ardenne now. Luckily, Lovis had brought him a cup of coffee to help shake off the morning lethargy. The piano music just wouldn’t leave him alone and was distracting him from his usual routine.

   “Oh, Bastian, you’re running late.” He was surprised to run into Odette out in the hallway as he made his way to the front door. “I will see you off then.” Her tone was so caring and considerate.

As if it were the last time, Bastian looked intently at her, who maintained a courteous smile. She was in one of her favourite, light blue, dresses. A pair of small pearl earrings glistened from her ears.

   As they descended the stairs together, neither of them said a word. They simply walked side by side, as if being in each others company was enough for them. It wasn’t until they walked the length of the entrance hall, as Bastian reached for the front door knob, that Odette spoke up.

   “Bastian, just a moment if you will,” Odette said, amidst the tinkle of piano music still playing in Odette’s head. As he stopped and turned to her, Odette reached up and adjusted his medal ribbons. “There, that’s better.”

   Bastian gave Odette a polite bow. He would return to Ardenne as soon as possible and they would spend more time together than they did yesterday.

   Bastian walked out the door and his footsteps crunched across the gravel of the driveway as he made his way to the car. He deceived himself into thinking this was just another day, all the while, the piano music became a haunting melody that played in his head, distracting him from his usual cool composure.

   He paused when he reached for the handle of the car door. His forehead furrowed further, and his tightly shut lips quivered slightly, and without any thought, he let impulse take over and he raced back up the stairs that led to the entrance of the mansion, then stopped in front of Odette. She looked up at him from beneath his shadow.

   “Bastian…”

   Odette didn’t have chance to say anything else, as her words stuck in her mouth, blocked where they were by Bastian’s lips firmly planted on hers.
