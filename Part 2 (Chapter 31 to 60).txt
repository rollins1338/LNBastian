Bastian's eyes honed in on the delicate pearl earrings that adorned Odette's lobes, and a note of disbelief crept into his voice,  "Surely, you don't mean to tell me that of all the jewelry I've gifted you, these are the only adornments that have caught your fancy?"  

His query hung in the air, his tone laced with a tinge of disappointment as he observed the simplicity of Odette's chosen accessories.

"Bastian, your jewelry is undeniably stunning, so I'm afraid an excess of embellishments would do this dress a disservice." Odette replied without missing a beat. Once again, she stood firm in her stance, unwilling to compromise on her vision of elegance and simplicity.

"Ah, you think," Bastian rose from his seat and echoed his wife's words. 

The fading light of the summer sun cast a warm glow over Odette's room, painting the space in hues of amber and gold that contrasted starkly with the palpable tension between the couple. The atmosphere between them was charged, heavy with unspoken words and a current of air that crackled with unexpressed emotions.

"Is it your belief that I'm asking about your opinion?" Bastian asked, his tone indicating a hint of irritation.

"And if that's not the case?" Odette countered.

Bastian's footsteps halted abruptly, just one step away from her.  "Your thoughts hold no interest for me, Odette. I am commanding you to discard that unsatisfactory ensemble and choose something more fitting." 

The silence that followed was palpable, the air thick with unspoken tension as the weight of his edict hung heavily in the room. Odette's eyes fluttered shut as she took a deep breath, gathering her courage to speak her mind. "I selected this attire with our guests for tonight in mind. You see, they were present on that fateful night, the very first time we met, and they bore witness to my past. They know everything," 

"And what of it?" Bastian retorted.

"I though that an overly extravagant and flamboyant attire would not only appear ridiculous but could also harm my reputation. Instead, I believed that projecting a humble and dignified image would be more effective in upholding my prestige." 

Despite feeling wounded and disheartened, Odette maintained her composure, while Bastian attentively observed her with a steely gaze. Odette was taken aback by the enigmatic smirk that crept across his lips, leaving her further bewildered.

"Your reasoning may be plausible, but I doubt it will have any impact. After all, who would concern themselves with the dignity of a woman who was sold off to settle her father's gambling debts?" Bastian's words landed like a crushing blow, yet he delivered them with a cool detachment. "Regardless of what clothes you wear, you'll only end up looking foolish," he added, tilting his head. A gentle sigh escaped his lips and brushed against Odette's ashen cheek, leaving her feeling utterly devastated.

"Then why are you insisting that I change my clothes if you think that way?" Odette shot back with a slow, dazed blink of her eyes.

"I must demonstrate to you, unequivocally, how your circumstances have altered."

"So you're worried about the possibility of a phony wife appearing comical, but you can't bear the thought of your wealth being threatened?" 

Odette's voice rang out, tinged with a hint of bitterness. Bastian cast a fleeting glance towards her reddened eyes before pivoting and making his way back to his seat with a measured stride.

Resuming his seat, he heaved a drawn-out sigh, laced with irritation. While he acknowledged her astute intellect, there were moments when she displayed a surfeit of knowledge coupled with a naiveté that seemed particularly pronounced in matters concerning honor and dignity.

Bastian raised his head and leaned heavily on the wingback of the chair. 

He purchased that lady. He had to be aware of how this marriage worked.

Until the contractual agreement was terminated, she was solely his property. With a disdainful disregard for anything that he deemed unworthy of his affluence, he refused to tolerate even the slightest hint of cheapness in his possessions. Thus, it was imperative that she appeared as the epitome of elegance and beauty, surpassing even the most illustrious women in the world. This was crucial to ensure that no one dared to detect even the faintest vestiges of the detested beggar princess in Bastian Klauswitz's wife.

"Save your thoughts for another day," Bastian advised with the demeanor of a doting husband who relished the joys of married life. "Leave the thinking to me. Your sole responsibility is to comply with the orders that I've conceived and issued. Surely, my wife hasn't forgotten that we're bound by a contract, right?" His eyes narrowed as he glanced at the desk clock, indicating that it was now time for the guests to commence their arrival.

"If your memory has failed you, do not hesitate to inform me. I do not mind revisiting the contract once more," Bastian said in a measured tone.

"I do not believe it is necessary for you to go through such great lengths," Odette replied calmly, her eyes welling up with transparent tears that shimmered like the turquoise sea. Despite the emotional turmoil stirring within her, she refused to shed a single tear. Rather, her countenance conveyed a sense of calm rationality, contrasting starkly with her initial conversation with him.

"Excellent. Then it appears that we have reached a conclusion," Bastian remarked, his smile graceful as he regarded his conversational partner with a measure of satisfaction. "Odette, I am issuing a command. Change your clothes immediately," he stated firmly, his tone brooking no argument any further.



Lucas struggled to open his mouth, his anxiety apparent. 

"That's the thing..." 

He finally managed to say, his words causing a stir among the young Klauswitz couple who had just arrived to greet the last guest. The couple looked at Lucas's companion with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, while the other guests who had already arrived and were engaged in conversation also took notice of the sudden disruption.

"I'm sorry, Bastian. I wish I could have told you earlier, but unfortunately, Emma was unwell today, and I had no choice but to take care of her. You understand, right? As for the event, it wouldn't have been appropriate for me to attend alone, so I asked Sandrine to come with me. She happened to have no plans either, so it worked out well. I hope you're not upset about it."

Lucas opened his eyes and began to rapidly fire off the excuses he had prepared earlier, hoping to assuage any concerns. Sandrine calmly waited for her turn to speak, apologizing with a friendly smile.

 "Captain, would it be possible for me to take Lucas' fiancée's place?" With a hopeful expression, Sandrine turned to Captain Klauswitz and asked. Despite her bold tone, her heart raced with nervous anticipation as she awaited his response.

"Of course." Bastian replied with practiced ease, donning his social smile once again. "Welcome, Countess Lenart," he added, extending a gracious welcome to Sandrine. 

Though he had already seen through her request, Bastian was glad to oblige. As Sandrine stepped into the parlor, she felt a wave of joy wash over her, replacing the feelings of hatred and resentment she had harbored towards him in the past. She greeted Bastian with the grace and elegance befitting a distinguished guest.

As Sandrine surveyed the familiar faces gathered at the dinner party, she couldn't help but notice how Mrs. Klauswitz stood out. With a gracious smile, Sandrine approached her and began the conversation with a fitting compliment. 

"Mrs. Klauswitz, you look even more beautiful since the last time I saw you. The captain is truly fortunate to have such a stunning wife," Sandrine said, her words flowing effortlessly. It wasn't difficult to pay Mrs. Klauswitz a compliment - after all, she shone brighter and radiated even more beauty than before she married Bastian.

"Thank you, Countess. You are stunning as always," Odette replied graciously. Sandrine noticed her delicate diamond earrings that glinted on Odette's earlobes. The same jewels adorned her slender neck, adding to her radiance. Sandrine admired how incredible Odette looked, considering the difficult circumstances she had faced just a few months ago

Sandrine's soaring elation was quickly dashed, plunging her into the depths of despair once again. Though Bastian was not a miserly man by nature, the extravagance of the situation seemed excessive to her. She struggled to maintain her smile, but the news of dinner being ready provided a welcome distraction. 

Sandrine looked on as Odette gracefully rose to her feet, holding her husband's hand. An involuntary sigh escaped her  lips as she watched the couple depart, her heart heavy with conflicting emotions.

Odette's dress was a sight to behold, its deep blue hue reminiscent of the vast, shimmering expanse of the night sea. The hem was adorned with imitation stones that twinkled like stars, intricately interwoven with silver threads. The level of care taken to attach and embroider each piece was evident, and the price tag of the dress must have been equivalent to that of a small fortune's worth of jewels. Even the officers, who were largely ignorant of women's clothing, couldn't help but steal glances at Bastian's stunning wife, their eyes widened with astonishment. It was a testament to Odette's beauty and elegance that she could command such attention with her mere presence.

Odette exuded an air of aloofness that seemed to shield her from the gazes of others, even though she undoubtedly understood their meaning. Bastian, who was escorting his radiant wife, was equally unfazed by the attention they garnered.

Sandrine was entranced, unable to take her eyes off the couple as they made their way to the terrace where the dining table was set. It was as if they were a pair of celestial beings, walking amongst mortals. The subtle flicker of candlelight only served to enhance their otherworldly aura, and Sandrine found herself completely spellbound.

Two years.

Yet, Sandrine's jealousy burned as hotly as ever, despite knowing that the woman would eventually be abandoned. Her emotions defied all reason and logic, controlling her heart with an iron grip.

Thankfully, the start of dinner brought an unexpected distraction in the form of Princess Isabelle. The royal had made a scandalous spectacle of herself at a recent ball, shocking the entire social world with her outrageous behavior. Sandrine found herself grateful for the diversion, as it provided a welcome respite from her own turbulent thoughts.

Indeed, It was a divine act of mercy.



The sky was a canvas of vibrant colors as the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting an otherworldly glow over the sea. 

Odette stood mesmerized by the view, her gaze fixed on the breathtaking scene. The flickering candles and shimmering glass lanterns that adorned the terrace only added to the enchanting atmosphere of the midsummer night.

The feast was a true triumph, despite Sandrine's initial concerns. Each dish was carefully crafted, and the guests savored every bite with delight. Even those who had initially regarded Sandrine with suspicion couldn't help but be impressed by the culinary skills on display.

As the night progressed, Sandrine found herself settling into a sense of contentment. The candlelight cast a warm glow across the faces of the guests, and the air was filled with the sound of laughter and easy conversation. Odette, too, seemed to be enjoying herself, though Sandrine could sense a hint of tension lurking beneath her composed facade.

But as the night wore on, a sudden interruption shattered the peaceful atmosphere. Bastian received an urgent phone call, and with a look of regret, he excused himself from the table. The jovial chatter of the guests died down in his absence, leaving a palpable sense of unease in its wake.

"I've been told that Duke Dyssen suffered serious injuries. How is his health lately? I ask because we have met before and I am genuinely concerned." One of the officers, who shared furtive glances with his colleagues, posed a question that seemed genuinely empathetic.

The name that echoed in her mind was that of Erich Faber, the very same officer who had subjected Odette to crude and vulgar language, if her memory was accurate.

"His condition has improved considerably, although mobility remains a challenge. Thank you for your kind inquiry, Captain Faber." Odette replied.  As soon as she finished speaking, a wave of laughter swept through the guests. It was an unbecoming display of vulgarity among such esteemed company.

Odette's fingers curled around the stem of her wine glass, her grip firm and unyielding. As she scanned the faces of the guests around her, it became apparent that Bastian's warning had been justified. Despite her best efforts, they were all laughing at her expense, their mirth a cruel reminder of the fragile alliances that governed the social world. It was clear that their kindness had been nothing more than a facade, a pretense put on for Bastian's benefit.

"It's fortunate that the Duke has recovered, isn't it? After all, he was able to gift Mrs. Klauswitz with such luxury because of that deal he made that night. It's almost as if he deserves to live a long life for being such a generous father." Erich's voice dripped with sarcasm as he spoke.

“Hey, Erich.” Lucas, the son of Count Ewald, caught Erich Faber's attention with a soft call, though it appeared Erich was considering halting regardless.

"What could have possibly happened that night to make it so intriguing? Do tell us, won't you?" she joked. It was Sandrine, who was observing the scene with leisure, causing the spark of the malice.

Sandrine's plea fell on deaf ears as her gaze remained fixed on Odette. The sea, which once glimmered with the light of the disappearing sun, now seemed to have absorbed a fragment of the encroaching darkness.


Chapter 35.
Blue Wick in the Flames.


"My father…" she began. In a moment of startling honesty, Odette's clear voice cut through the thick tension in the room.  "My father had an insatiable gambling addiction. He was willing to risk anything - even his own flesh and blood - to feed his habit. And so, he wagered me as the stakes, and eager participants eagerly joined in the game." The weight of her revelation hung heavy in the air, and for a moment, silence reigned supreme.

With a deep frown etched on his face, Erich Faber watched on as Bastian's wife took center stage, stealing his chance to be the main character. Despite the humiliation she was subjected to, she remained surprisingly composed, exuding an air of unshakable calmness that even Erich left dumbfounded. The performance was nothing short of spectacular, leaving him awestruck and feeling foolish for having made such a fuss over something so trivial.

 "Bastian emerged as the winner of that bet, and he graciously allowed me to leave unscathed, with all the dignity and honor befitting of a soldier. It was only made possible because of the firm support of his friends, for which I am eternally grateful."  With a grateful smile on her lips, Odette recounted the events that had transpired.

Erich laughed in sheer amazement as he listened to her cleverly beautified version of events, which, to his surprise, worked in her favor. Though it wasn't entirely accurate, the fact that it wasn't entirely wrong perplexed him even more. Despite his reservations, he couldn't deny that she had won, and her stunning counterattack had left him reeling, unable to come up with a suitable response.

"How utterly romantic!" Sandrine exclaimed, unable to contain her exaggerated admiration. "It sounds like it must have been love at first sight."

Setting down her glass, she gazed at Odette with a mixture of awe and envy, leaving Erich feeling somewhat uncomfortable in her presence. Sensing the awkwardness, he quickly excused himself and withdrew quietly.

All eyes were fixed on Sandrine as she regarded Odette with a sharp, scrutinizing gaze. Though Odette appeared to be humble and unassuming, Sandrine couldn't help but wonder if her apparent lack of arrogance was just a facade. Perhaps it would have been better if Odette's arrogance was sky-high, but Sandrine couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this seemingly soft-hearted woman than met the eye.

As Sandrine continued to study Odette, she couldn't help but notice the desperation in her calm demeanor. If there was truly nothing to hide, then why was Odette so intent on maintaining her composure? It was a question that lingered in Sandrine's mind long after the conversation had ended, leaving her with an unshakeable sense of intrigue and curiosity.

"Who knows, perhaps your husband might be a different man if someone else had won that fateful night," Sandrine's smile broadened as she lobbed a taunt disguised as a joke at Odette.

She was determined to rattle Odette's seemingly unflappable composure, to see how long she could keep up her facade of calm and control. But as she watched Odette's expression remain unchanged, Sandrine began to wonder if there was more to this woman than she had initially thought.

"Surely everyone should have worked harder to seize such a golden opportunity, should they not, Mrs. Klauswitz?" she taunted, her eyes glittering with malicious delight.

As Sandrine continued to poke and prod at Odette, the tension in the room grew palpable, and the once-excited guests fell silent, their laughter fading away into a tense hush. 

Sandrine let out a soft, wistful sigh and followed the direction of everyone's gaze, her eyes settling on the terrace where Bastian stood, his sudden appearance taking her by surprise.



The heavy silence that had settled over the garden was abruptly shattered by the sound of footsteps echoing through the night air. With a faint, enigmatic smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, Bastian moved steadily towards his wife, moving with a fluid grace that spoke of years of military training.

The conversation with Thomas Muller was unusually brief, with key points summarized and straightforward answers from Bastian. But upon returning to the terrace, a tense situation awaited as Erich was on the verge of detonating a figurative bomb. Curiosity piqued, Bastian chose to carefully observe the unfolding events before taking action.

With Odette put on the chopping block, Bastian's curiosity was piqued as he eagerly awaited to see which path she would choose. It was a test of sorts, and unfortunately, the outcome did not meet Bastian's expectations.

While the strategy itself was solid, Odette's lack of skill left a gap that Sandrine was able to expertly exploit. Sandrine possessed the very qualities of a wife that Bastian required, and it was a testament to her character. The current Mrs. Klauswitz was Odette, however, and the preservation of her dignity was intimately tied to Bastian's honor as a husband.

"I'm afraid that scenario simply wouldn't have come to pass," A soft smile played across Bastian's lips as he stood behind Odette's chair, exuding an air of possessiveness as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders.  "Even if someone else had emerged victorious, the end result would have remained unchanged. I would have simply stolen it," Bastian declared, turning to look lovingly at his wife. Leaning in close, he whispered affectionately into her ear.

Odette's head whipped around in shock, and an involuntary gasp escaped her lips as she found herself face to face with her husband. His proximity was unnerving, and even as he feigned the role of a tender lover, the frigidity in his gaze remained unyielding. It was like staring into the heart of a flickering flame.

Caught off guard, Odette felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her as she attempted to turn her head away. But the hands that clutched her shoulders held firm, and before she knew it, their lips encountered. 

Suppressing a scream, Odette stiffened as Bastian suddenly kissed her. Despite the crude laughter and taunts of the other guests, she couldn't help but feel grateful for their presence. Their rowdy behavior had provided the perfect cover for the explosion of emotions that threatened to consume her. Thankfully, Bastian knew when to draw the line and withdrew without overstepping his bounds.

He took his seat with a smile on his face, emitting a nonchalance that fit right back into the original course of the dinner party. No one mentioned that night at all as they instead relished in their conversation, laughter, and the delights of the June evening. Even the obviously malicious Erich Faber and Countess Lenart contributed to the laid-back mood.

A sense of relief washed over Odette as she exhaled deeply. However, her moment of respite was short-lived, as she suddenly felt a large, firm grip enveloping her hand. 

The hand belonged to Bastian.

Despite her attempts to resist, his grasp remained unyielding as he gently guided her hand onto his lap.

As Sandrine observed the newlyweds closely, she couldn't help but feel a tinge of envy bubble up inside her. Despite her mixed emotions, she plastered on a bright smile and delivered a backhanded compliment with expert precision. "My, my, I must say I didn't expect to witness such a display of love from you, Bastian. You and Odette make such a lovely couple," she remarked, her words dripping with both sweetness and spite. Although her smile remained fixed, her eyes betrayed a hint of jealousy that she had no intention of concealing.

A sudden warmth crept up Odette's cheeks as she came to the realization of just how peculiar her marriage truly was. 

It was a feeling akin to being treated as a mistress by another man's wife, and it left her with a sense of discomfort that she couldn't quite shake off. 

However, Bastian still seemed unwilling to let her go, a fact that left her feeling both bewildered and conflicted. Even though it was painfully obvious that Sandrine harbored deep feelings for him.

Bastian applied a strong pressure to Odette's gripped hand. Then he cautiously wound his finges around her immovable ones. She made every effort to oppose it, but the strength gap was too great. 

Their hands soon formed a flawless interlock.

As an unfamiliar sensation crept up on her, Odette felt her face flush with embarrassment. Hastily lowering her head in an attempt to hide her rosy cheeks, she couldn't help but feel a sense of shame wash over her. Despite her inner turmoil, Bastian carried on with his conversation as if nothing were amiss, leaving her feeling lost and alone. 

Unable to meet Sandrine's gaze for the duration of the meal, Odette was consumed by a gnawing sense of guilt, as though she were betraying something sacred.

 The feeling was a repulsive one, casting a dark shadow deep within her heart that seemed impossible to shake off.



 "There are still quite a few parts of the house that require the touch of a skilled hostess," Sandrine's voice rang out merrily, her words echoing through the stillness of the hallway. Pausing for a moment to clarify, Odette pivoted on her heel to face the group of ladies following her, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Following the conclusion of the evening meal, Bastian and his companions made their way to the study, leaving her to take charge of the ladies' entertainment. While refreshments and music were typically the go-to options for such occasions, Odette decided to take a different approach. Seeking counsel from the esteemed Countess Trier, it was determined that a house tour would be a more fitting choice for their inaugural hosting event.

"Indeed, the guest quarters and shared spaces have yet to be fully adorned, and the outbuilding is nearly complete, with only the exterior awaiting its final touches." A warm smile graced Odette's lips as she replied. Sandrine, acknowledging Odette's response with a nod of her head, brazenly pushed open the door at the end of the hallway, revealing a cozy study designed for the hostess to receive and entertain her guests.

With a sense of ownership, Sandrine entered the space with a swagger. While doing so, the other visitors dispersed around the corner, avidly taking in the splendour of the mansion. Odette motioned to the waiting maid, who immediately brought the group back to the terrace when she saw Sandrine there. Odette, however, was left with no choice other than to follow Sandrine inside the inviting study.

Sandrine looked over the still-empty cabinets and walls before settling down on the sofa in front of the big fireplace. Odette softly shut the door as she observed the situation. It appeared that a conversation she didn't particularly enjoy was about to begin.

"The trending painting styles these days are far too vague for my liking," Sandrine arched her eyebrow as Odette drew closer, her tone conveying her disapproval of contemporary art. "I much prefer classic paintings, although themes like history and religion can be a bit weighty. Personally, I prefer bright and lively landscape paintings."

With a pointed stare, Sandrine made her preferences clear. "Rather than a painting, I would suggest a mirror atop the fireplace," she instructed. "And for the lamp and clock on the mantelpiece, I would choose Fellise. Berg's pieces lack the necessary delicate aesthetic.  I spent my childhood in Felia, so you should be able to understand my taste."

Odette's face contorted with confusion as she gazed down at Sandrine, who was standing on the opposite side of the sofa. "I don't understand what you’re talking about, Countess."

The lanterns cast a soft glow on the two women as they locked eyes, their expressions starkly contrasting.

"Please remember to maintain the decorum of a guest." Odette was the first to break the silence, her tone firm but polite.

"I will maintain appearances in public to spare Bastian's shame. But let me make this clear: I have no intention of accepting a mere two-year employee as my Bastian’s wife, especially in private." Sandrine cut to the chase and made her position clear, no longer interested in playing games of tug of war.

"Surprised, my dear? Did you truly believe that the marriage contract was a secret only shared between you and Bastian?" Her words were like a dagger, cutting through the silence as Odette's eyes conveyed her shock and confusion.

"I understand. Countess, you may have a delusion of a special relationship with him. It's amusing, but I get it. Bastian is also taking advantage of you, and young men need that kind of entertainment, above all." Odette said.

Her pallid hand caught Sandrine's attention. Even the last sliver of sympathy she had for the lady who had sold herself for money vanished when she thought back to Bastian clutching that hand firmly.

"I do hope you're taking the necessary precautions and being cautious," 

"What do you mean by that?" Odette's expression turned pale as she asked back.

"Let me be clear, Odette. You should not entertain the thought of getting pregnant and trying to replace me. While I may tolerate your presence to some extent, if you were to have a child with Bastian, you would face a world of pain and heartbreak."

"You can't be serious. Are you trying to threaten me?" Odette's mask of politeness crumbled as she exclaimed. 

“What else might there be in this discussion?” Sandrine gave a nonchalant shrug and a small smile, as if to say that there was nothing left to discuss in the conversation. 

Odette seemed to have finally understood what fates saved for her.

Chapter 36.
Odette's Business.


The serene tranquility of dawn was suddenly disrupted by a gentle yet distinct tapping sound that caught Odette's attention as she was absentmindedly gazing into the mirror while brushing her hair. 

She turned her head in surprise, wondering who or what could be causing the commotion. Just as she was about to collect her thoughts, another knock echoed through the stillness, but this time it came from an unexpected direction - the passageway that led to the couple's bedroom.

In a flash of realization, Odette swiftly rose from her seat, anticipating the arrival of someone she knew. And as if on cue, a familiar voice broke through the silence, confirming her suspicions.

“Odette.” Bastian called her out from behind the door.

“Please come in.” Odette welcomed Bastian and scurried to tidy up her disheveled dressing table, ensuring everything was in its proper place. With one final adjustment, she carefully returned the violet cream to its designated spot, and in that moment, the door - which appeared nearly camouflaged against the wall - began to creak open.

And there, emerging from the other side, stood Bastian, garbed in a stunning blue-gray gown that draped elegantly around him, exuding a refined aura that was impossible to ignore.

Odette found herself standing still, unsure of what to do next, while uncertainty hung in the air. "Please tell, what seems to be the matter," She asked hesitantly.

The door had never been opened before, despite the fact that they had spent several weekends together. Contrary to her, who found it puzzling, Bastian appeared utterly uninterested. 

As he stood frozen in his tracks, his gaze fixed on Odette, he halted his journey from the dressing table to the bed. The color of his hair seemed deeper than usual, as though it had recently been drenched in a shower. The loose-fitting gown he wore clung slightly to his skin, revealing lingering droplets of moisture, glistening in the light.

Againts his vulnerable and unkempt state, his eyes remained frigid and unyielding, as if they were impervious to any emotion. The stillness of his gaze lingered on for what seemed like an eternity, leaving Odette feeling both uneasy and exposed. 

Even with her best efforts to project confidence, she found herself retreating, almost as if she could physically feel the weight of his piercing stare. It was a peculiar sensation, like grains of sand that had been heated by the scorching sun trickling down her skin.

Bastian's gaze traveled slowly from the tips of Odette's slipper-clad toes, up to her clasped hands, and finally settled on her flushed face. Without a word, he turned and made his way over to the tea table by the window, where he took a seat.

 It wasn't until then that Odette began to understand the source of his discontent. The expression etched on his face was unmistakably one of displeasure.

Odette let out a sharp gasp as she finally dared to draw a breath and turned around. The sight that greeted her in the mirror was enough to make her almost scream in surprise, causing her to quickly cover her mouth with her hand.

 Reflected in the glass was her figure, clad only in white muslin pajamas that left little to the imagination. Every contour of her body was on full display through the sheer fabric.

In a sudden panic, Odette hastily clasped her hands over her chest and scanned the room with a dazed expression. Her gown lay within reach on the bed bench, but the mere thought of crossing the room to retrieve it in front of her husband, who may as well have been staring directly through her, made her feel as if she were standing there naked.

"J-Just look away for a second," Odette struggled to open her mouth and spoke in a trembling voice. She knew that what she was about to say might make her appear weak, but she saw no other way out of this awkward situation. 

Bastian laughed and sighed while gazing at Odette with his arms relaxed. Fortunately, despite his apparent shock, he showed enough consideration to glance out the window.

Odette didn't approach the bed bench until that point. She felt even more ashamed after tightly draping a garment over her body. How could she more concerned about her messy table? It was completely absurd.

"Thank you, I'm done," Odette muttered softly, her voice barely above a whisper. Her heart raced as she fought the urge to flee from the room, but she tried her best to appear strong and determined.

Bastian turned his head slowly, his expression unchanged from before. His displeasure was certain, and Odette could feel it like a heavy weight pressing down on her.

"Please sit.“ Bastian motioned for Odette to take a seat. His hand flicking away a few strands of hair that had fallen across his forehead. "There's something we need to discuss about the dinner party," he said, his tone as cold and callous as ever.

Odette's professional demeanor was greatly appreciated. It was undoubtedly the case, at least for the time being.



Againts the trembling of her fingers subsiding, Odette continued to clutch the gown tightly, her knuckles turning white from the force of her grip. Bastian watched her silently, noting the extreme tension in her body.

Odette had already shown him everything, so he didn't understand why she was clinging to the robe so firmly. He knew it would be pointless, so he didn't bother to say anything about it. He didn't want to waste any more time waiting for a disoriented and perplexed woman because it was already late at night.

Bastian wasted no time getting to the point. "I didn't bring you here to play the role of an elegant princess," he said bluntly, his tone cutting like a knife.

Odette blinked in surprise, her eyes locked onto Bastian's face. "Could you explain it to me so that I can understand?"

"You married a commoner, Odette," His voice laced with disdain. "And as a commoner's wife, you are now also a commoner."

A steely glint flashed in Odette's eyes as she held Bastian's gaze. "I am well aware of that,"

"Are you?" A sly smile played on Bastian's lips as he leaned in towards her."Then perhaps it's time you started acting like it. Would it be clear if I said that I didn't want to see the pitiful woman who was crushed and eaten in pieces in the hands of acting respectably?"

"I apologize for my response at the dinner table. I was taken aback and caught off guard. However, I can't agree with the idea of abandoning my class consciousness," Odette shouted, her voice steady despite the flush on her cheeks. "I made my judgment based on my own thoughts and beliefs, not on my social status."

Thought.

As the word left her lips, Odette's eyes lit up with a glimmer of delight.

"Regardless of my birth or marital status, I am still myself. And I believe I fulfilled my duties as a gracious host tonight." Her inner turmoil was overwhelming, yet she refused to back down without a fight. 

She gritted her teeth, determined to keep her composure in the face of the man's friends and lover. Their contemptuous sneers and insults had stung like bee stings, but she refused to let them see her pain. 

For Odette, it was all about keeping a promise, fulfilling a responsibility. She couldn't afford to let her position slip away, not when she had fought so hard to get here. Even as they treated her like a common prostitute, she maintained her poise and dignity, clinging to the manners of the Dyssen family.

With the weight of duty on her shoulders, Odette gazed out at the endless expanse of the night sea, holding back tears that threatened to spill over. 

She couldn't let Bastian see her weakness - this was all just part of the contract, after all. 

But as she struggled to bear the burden of her responsibilities as Mrs. Klauswitz, she couldn't help but feel the ache in her heart. It was a pain born of the realization that she was not yet accustomed to carrying the weight of things that were not truly hers to bear.

"Do you always hold such a high opinion of yourself?" 

Bastian's voice was laced with a hint of amusement as he questioned Odette.

"I'll only show appreciation for things that are worthy of it," Odette squared her shoulders and met Bastian's gaze, her anger palpable.

With time, she knew she would adapt to the situation at hand. Time had given her only one gift, but it was enough. She had become accustomed to the discomfort and found solace in it.

“I don't put any stock in the word of a woman who has has forgotten the advice I gave her earlier tonight."  The air between them crackled with tension as Bastian reclined in his chair, his expression unreadable.

"You need not worry about that. Your thoughts are yours, and I will make sure to remember them," Odette assured.

"You know that, so why you're disregarding my advice."

"The advice you provided earlier was solely for the benefit of Mrs. Klauswitz's business. When the time comes for me to act as your wife, I will strive to align with your beliefs."

"And what about now?" 

"Would it be appropriate to call it as ….Odette's business?" Odette, who was having trouble, posed an odd query. It didn't appear like she was attempting to make a joke out of it, judging by the sincerity of her look, which lacked any indication of humour.

Bastian's laughter echoed through the room as he finally understood Odette's solution. The woman before him, once so composed and reserved, now held her breath with anticipation. It was as if a new side of her was emerging, a side that wasn't afraid to take risks and find unconventional solutions. 

Bastian couldn't help but marvel at this new Odette, 

Nothing else, just Odette.

Bastian let out a deep, slow breath as his laughter subsided, and his eyes fixed on his wife with a blank expression. The memories of the dinner and the irritation caused by her disapproval swirled in his mind, but he tried to push them aside. In the face of his best efforts, he couldn't help but be struck by her unyielding presence. Stripped of all artifice, she was simply stunning, and Bastian felt his resolve falter in the face of her beauty.

Bastian gazed intently at the gown in Odette's hand, his eyes settling on the wedding ring adorning her finger. “So, when do you plan on resuming your duties as my wife?"

"In the eyes of those who believe I am your wife, I will be Mrs. Klauswitz."

"So, does that mean not right now?" Bastian sought clarification, asking.

"Yes, that's correct. However, if you have any advice to offer, I am willing to listen."

"Ah, I see. I thought you were shouting your opinions to silence me.”

Odette swiftly shook her head, causing her hair to sway like the dark night. "My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that," she expressed. "If my desires don't align with yours, please do let me know. Although I can't transform into a new person overnight, I will strive to minimize the differences between us to the best of my ability." Her gaze towards Bastian became gentle and tender as she uttered.

“I’d rather have a heartless winner than an honorable loser.” Bastian said. His eyes drifted from her locks to her elegant hand, which clutched the fabric of her attire tightly.

Odette pondered deeply before speaking, "But even if it means sacrificing dignity?"

"Winning at all costs is the essence of Klauswitz's dignity."

"But that shouldn't apply to Countess Lenart."

"Why not?" Bastian asked curiously,

Odette hesitated before continuing, "Because that day when you... Countess Lenart was much more significant to you."

“During our role-playing as husband and wife, I believe I made it obvious that I would put my wife's needs first. Could it be that your memory is only half-functioning?” Bastian's eyes lifted gradually from the body that Odette was trying to shield from his view.

"I understand that, but Countess Lenart is aware of our agreement. It's challenging to act as your spouse in her presence…" 

"During that moment, feel free to behave as you wish. Keep in mind the considerable sum you'll be receiving in exchange for your services." Bastian rose from his chair, dismissing his jaded counsel. A warm flush of indignation crept up from his rigid posterior, intensifying with each passing moment. The situation seemed increasingly preposterous as time wore on, but he was keenly aware that he held the power to act as he pleased.

Bastian had always held little value in satisfying his primal urges, and this remained true. He knew full well that he had the authority to disregard the agreement, but he questioned whether it was worth the repercussions that could follow a fleeting impulse. The answer was clear - it was a clear-cut defeat.

After two years of playing the role of a counterfeit spouse, the entirety of Odette's existence, as deemed by Bastian, was limited to this.

"Then get some rest, Odette," Bastian uttered curtly, his gaze fixed upon her dazed, blue-green eyes.

As he made his way across the room and opened the door to leave, Odette remained silent, offering no reply until the door had closed shut behind him once more.


Chapter 37.
A Grateful Person.


"What does it feel like to be a newlywed? How are things for you going?" Tira asked an intriguing question as she talked about her dorm experience and recent friendships.

"I'm doing quite well myself," Odette replied calmly after replacing the handset.

Tira raised an eyebrow inquisitively. "Is that all?" she asked.

After much contemplation, Odette smiled, "I'm feeling quite comfortable and finding enjoyment in things."

"Where's the new bride who was describing her newlywed life so poorly?" Her explanation caused Tira to burst into laughter, "You're more like the dorm president than anything, with how strict you are." Tira's voice then softened as she reigned in her excitement.

"Hey, sister."

"Yes?" 

"Thank you." Tira expressed her gratitude with a heartfelt

"For what?" Odette asked confusingly. 

"Just all of it. I think I understand now that we live apart and that sister loves me very much. So, thank you and sorry again." Her emotions shifted as she went from excitement to tears, "Are you happy?" Tira asked through her sobs.

"Yes, I am happy."

Tira then posed an unexpectedly serious question, "How's the captain? Does he care for and love my sister very much?"

Odette gradually unfurled her eyes and shifted her posture to rise from her seated position. As she did so, the brilliant beams of summer light streamed through the windows overlooking the ocean, casting a radiant glow upon the unadorned walls of the petite study, the exact spot that Sandrine had designated for displaying her breathtaking landscape artwork.

"Sister?" 

Odette was startled out of her daydream by Tira's uneasy tone. "Yes, Tira." She beamed, stretching the corners of her lips into a radiant smile, as if Tira were standing right before her.

"Well…I'm grateful for him," Odette spoke openly in an effort to ease Tira's concerns.

Though Bastian Klauswitz's heartless words sometimes wounded her deeply, Odette couldn't deny her gratitude towards him. He had swooped in just in time when her family was on the brink of destruction, saving them all from certain doom.

His aid may have been motivated by his own agenda, but the magnitude of the favor he had done for her was unlike anything she had ever experienced before. And for that, she was filled with an overwhelming sense of appreciation towards her husband, even if their marriage was merely a means to an end.

"Phew, that's a relief. My mind feels so much lighter now." Tira's cheerful tone returned in a flash, as she eagerly launched into a discussion about her upcoming weekend plans - a picnic with her pals, a city tour, and even some tennis lessons. It was a life she couldn't have dreamed of just a mere month ago.

"I'm afraid I have to go now. I'll give you a ring next time!" Tira's voice was drowned out by the clamor of her rowdy surroundings, indicating that her friends had arrived.

"Goodbye, sister! Love you!" Tira bellowed at the top of her lungs before promptly ending the call.

"Goodbye, my dear little sister. I love you." Odette murmured the words she hadn't had a chance to utter before ending the call. After hearing Tira's voice, the surroundings felt even more foreign and desolate, as if her sister's presence had made all the difference.

Preferring not to indulge in her own show, Odette rang the bell to summon her maid. After handing over the mail that needed to be sent out urgently, she received a flurry of new letters - most of which were party invitations.

Sitting down at her desk, she began to sift through the envelopes, starting with the first one. It was from the wife of Admiral Demel, Bastian's superior, who extended an invitation for them to visit their summer residence.

Odette presented a letter of introduction from the maids who had interviewed a few days prior. "You may peruse it and make a decision at your leisure," she stated.

As she set the letter aside, the maid presented the next stack of papers. "I believe the current staff at the mansion is still adequate. Is it truly essential to expand our roster of servants?" Odette questioned.

"Master has issued the order," the head maid replied resolutely as soon as Odette finished her inquiry. Without further objections, Odette accepted the answer.

The household staff were fiercely loyal to their master, and the greater their admiration and reverence for him, the more discontent they harbored towards the hostess.

They did not dislike Odette personally; rather, they did so in opposition to her social standing and family. They considered their master's decision to marry a woman of low birth, who had led a fulfilling life without it, as a grievous affront. They thought their master had overcome the restrictions of the old world, but his marriage to Odette, only brought him to his knees once more.

Odette comprehended the root of their animosity towards her. Bastian, being the grandson of an antiques merchant, was ostracized by the aristocratic society. But, to the common public, he was the personification of the future and their victor.

“I'll eat a quick lunch here. “Odette read the last of the letters and then made a kind request. The time for a return trip arrived as the busy days of accommodating the stream of visitors came to an end. The summer seemed to have vanished by the time this task was done.

Odette was about to ask Bastian's opinion after choosing her invitations when the head maid graciously showed up and presented a sumptuous spread fit for a royalty. A neatly organized platter of freshly made lemonade was served to go along with the expertly made cucumber sandwiches and the cool bowl of chilled tomato soup. This wasn't just any ordinary meal; it included a carefully chosen assortment of foods that weren't usually among Odette's likes.

"Thank you, Dora. Go take a rest now.” Odette quickly thanked Dora for her tireless work and motioned for the maid to take a well-earned rest. She finished her sandwich and looked at the catalogue the interior decorator she had met the day before had put on her desk.

Odette realized that a trip to the artist's workshop was necessary in order to fulfil the timeframe for choosing the ideal picture to hang on the library's walls. It was essential to examine a priceless piece of art in person before making a choice.

"Dora, is there anything else that requires my attention that I may assist you with?" With a gentle yet commanding presence, Odette asked of the head maid who still lingered in the room. 

"O no, Madam. If you need any additional help, don't be afraid to call me." Dora immediately changed her expression and made a courteous bow before leaving. Odette continued to enjoy the last bites of her sandwich and the last ladle of soup as the door softly closed behind her.

The head maid overlooked one important aspect about Odette: her extraordinary capacity to put up with things she disliked. 

She persevered with the lunch despite being a little irritated by the extremely sweet and sour lemonade. Odette soon left the quick meal behind and jumped back into her job as hostess. She was determined not to cause any trouble again as the weekend was coming up rapidly than expected.



"Master, you ran faster than normal today." Butler Lovis greeted Bastian with a beaming smile. 

In his moments of respite, Bastian found solace in the rhythm of his daily jog through the park. The distance and duration of his route remained unwavering, a testament to his steadfast discipline. After suffering a setback upon returning from Trosa, he had seen a marked improvement in his speed in recent days, surpassing his previous records with ease.

 As Bastian returned home, a smile of contentment graced his features, but he remained silent. Butler Lovis, anticipating his needs, trailed closely behind, bearing a refreshing cup of lemon-infused water, thoughtfully prepared beforehand.

"I have arranged for additional staff to be stationed at the Ardene Mansion. Coupled with the servants who will join us when the Master relocates overseas, we shall have a surplus of staff." Butler Lovis trailed Bastian like a loyal shadow and uttered. 

Bastian acknowledged with a swift node, drained his glass of water in a single gulp and returned it to the tray. "I am grateful for your efforts. I will be heading out in an hour. I shall drive myself, so there is no need for a driver." 

"Understood, Master. I shall have the car prepared. Will you be departing for Ardene immediately after dinner?" 

"No, I will be spending the weekend in Ratz." 

Lovis' eyes widened, "Madam must have been waiting for quite some time, then."

He didn't say anything beforehand, so preparations for his arrival in Ardene must be well on. Bastian, however, seemed totally unconcerned so Lovis stopped interfering.

"I shall inform Madam that due to your workload, Master, you will be spending the weekend in Ratz." Lovis was so able to ease the surprise situation by offering this suitable alternative.

With a nod Bastian dismissed Lovis and gave him a look that hinted at his desire to be alone. Lovis lingered for a moment, watching his master ascend the stairs. 

Despite his busy schedule, Bastian made it a priority to spend time with his new bride on weekends. Lovis couldn't help but feel a tinge of regret that his master's newfound marital bliss would go unacknowledged. 

However, he knew better than to seek any kind of response from Bastian, so he simply swallowed his disappointment and carried on with his duties.



For the first time in a very long time, Odette wore her favorite outfit. Bastian was not delighted with the clothing because it was so light blue.

Odette added a pair of tiny pearl earrings to complete her decor. Her face had a bright smile and liveliness for the first time in a long, with little to no makeup on.

An unexpected weekend without her husband left her feeling a bit disoriented, but she quickly formulated a solid plan. Her first order of business was to head to Ratz to select some paintings, followed by a leisurely private tea time.

A tranquil outside cafe seemed preferable to a plush hotel lounge that appeared to have been converted from a social hub. She got an idea of choosing some books from a neighboring bookstore to read.

Odette turned around with her handbag and parasol in hand and be greeted by her driver. 

“Hello madam, this is Hans. Which car will you be requiring, madam?" He asked in an extremely polite way, leaving Odette a bit taken aback by the outrage of the question.

Odette furrowed her brow, deep in thought. The unfamiliar language and customs of the mansion left her feeling bewildered. “I’m sorry, I’m still getting the hang of things here. Could you please explain in more detail?” 

Hans, the attendant, nodded reassuringly, “Certainly, madam,” his kind smile put her at ease. "The cars that had been kept in a different warehouse were transported to the new mansion's garage. You can select the cars here based on your preferences because that is where the master frequently drives. Do you want to see it for yourself?” asked Hans politely.

"Yes, I would like that."

Odette showed an awkward expression. It appeared as though she had stumbled into a Wonderland. This feeling intensified as the attendant led the door to the garage to open.

Cars of all sizes and hues were neatly arranged in a line. She was perplexed by the scene because she had imagined no more than two cars to the most.

Hans gestured towards the rows of sleek cars lined up in the expansive garage. "If you're not inclined towards a car, we could arrange for a carriage," he suggested.

Odette's eyes widened as she took in the sight of the impressive vehicles before her. "Uh... no, I don't think that will be necessary," she rejected, her gaze still fixed on the collection of cars.

As the image of Bastian's request replayed in her head, Odette tried to compose herself as a gracious hostess, but the strange sight in front of her was difficult to shake off. "Can you tell me which car my husband uses the least?" she asked, and after some hesitation.

“Hmm… This one, I believe, madam.” Hans pointed to a gleaming yellow convertible tucked away at the back of the garage.

"I'll take that one, then."  Odette reacted as if she had just finished a difficult assignment.

She appeared to need a little more time than she had anticipated to get used to the Wonderland environment.


Chapter 38.
Husband's Seat.

With one look, Franz was certain - the graceful figure moving through the exhibition room, basked in the radiant summer light, was none other than Odette. 

As she navigated the space, her movements were fluid and effortless, akin to a swimmer gliding through water. The gallery owner trailed behind her, beaming like a loyal companion.

When Odette took the initiative to inspect the enticing landscape painting hanging in the middle of the room, Franz refrained from doing so. The artwork was beautiful to look at, but it didn't make an impression on him. However, it seemed that Odette lacked the discerning lens of a true lover of art.

"A wise move. It's an item that will become more valuable with time.“

Odette was swayed by the art dealer's sweet talk, but little did she know that her final decision would be a regrettable one.

Franz exhaled and forced a searing sting of disappointment down his throat. The disillusionment he felt every time he spoke to his fiancée, whose intellect was hard to discover, Odette turned her back.

Amidst the dimly lit corner of the room, there hung a painting that Franz had purchased out of obligation to a personal connection with the artist. The artwork, However, had been neglected due to its lack of marketability. Ironically, it was the same piece that Franz had selected for himself.

"Can I also purchase this painting?" Odette inquired without hesitation, revealing her interest in the artwork.

"The painting is still available, but there is another potential buyer who is considering it," the seller replied, hinting at a potential competition for the piece.

The art dealer was taken aback by the revelation and turned his head in surprise, while Odette's eyes instinctively shifted towards Franz.

"Come to think of it, you both are related!" the dealer suddenly exclaimed, having belatedly recollected their familial ties.

As Franz caught sight of Odette, his body tensed involuntarily, and he held his breath in anticipation. However, it didn't take long for Odette to recognize him.

"Hello, Franz! It's been a while,"  

Odette greeted Franz with a friendly smile, prompting him to step out of the shadows. Nervously, he swallowed and furrowed his brow as the sudden brightness caused discomfort to his eyes.

Franz remained silent for a brief moment, gazing intently at Odette before finally speaking. "May I ask why you're here?" 

He moved closer. Since he had lost weight, Franz appeared more restless and alert.

"What is your reason for wanting to purchase that painting?" Franz asked inquisitively, lifting his glasses with his fingertips before providing an explanation. The curious looks of those around him went unnoticed.

"Simply because it is a stunning work of art," 

Odette answered, diffusing the awkward tension with a straightforward response, but Franz appeared unrelenting in his questioning.

"People often criticize artists for haphazardly scattering colors without any basic knowledge of art, which is why some remain obscure.”

"Perhaps, but I believe that beauty standards are subjective and vary from person to person," 

"In that case, what is it about this painting that appeals to you?" Franz pressed further, causing a glimmer of a different color to appear in his otherwise gloomy gray eyes.

"It's like a dream, the way it captures the flow of light and air. I'm particularly drawn to the colors that evoke the feeling of dusk. Although the subject matter isn't apparent, dreams are inherently mysterious and beautiful," Odette explained, seeking Mr. Lindzer's opinion.

Luckily, the art dealer quickly nodded his head in agreement, offering his support.

"Absolutely, that's what makes it so appealing. And I can assure you that your friend shares the same sentiment, Mrs. Klauswitz, so you need not worry," the dealer reassured her.

Odette smiled, "You and Franz must be quite close." 

"In the Ratz art world, there's hardly anyone who hasn't heard of Franz Klauswitz. He's a distinguished collector, knowledgeable in art, and when we have discussions like these, he can come across a bit abrupt, but it's never with ill-intent."

"I'll take that painting,” Franz interrupted, cutting off the art dealer before he could finish speaking.

"Look, Franz," The art dealer shot Franz an icy glare, as though he regretted recommending a painting that was now being sold for a low price. But Franz paid him no mind, his eyes fixed on Odette with the same intensity as when he discovered a hidden masterpiece.

"One day, that painting will be worth more than all the other works in this gallery combined. I trust your eyes, Odette," Franz told Odette.

"But, didn't you make the decision to purchase it before me?"

"It's alright. I can give it to someone who truly understands its value."

While he was talking, Franz walked towards Odette with a fresh energy that gave his pale cheeks life.

The sudden news of his marriage and the sense of inferiority that gnawed at his chest whenever he thought of the woman who had been defiled by Bastian vanished instantly, like snow melting in the sun.

At best, the body was nothing more than a hollow shell that that vile beast of a Bastian had just defiled. Franz couldn't bring himself to empathize with the woman on a spiritual level. Yet, Odette remained untainted, retaining her noble and innocent essence in his eyes.

"Perhaps I could offer my assistance in selecting paintings for you, and in return, would you be willing to join me for a cup of tea?"

Franz summoned all his courage and spoke with a tremble in his voice. The exhilarating rhythm of his heartbeat resonated within him.



His piercing eyes were inevitably drawn to the vivid and striking yellow car as he scanned his surroundings keenly. 

Bastian was about to look away, when a familiar figure caught his attention, leaving him stunned. 

Odette. His wife.  

She wasn’t supposed to be there. However, there she was, her presence not mistaking his eyes. 

Bastian stood transfixed, gazing through the expansive lobby staring at his wife. Across the wide street, she emerged from the building like a crescent moon, and even at a far distance, her ethereal presence was unmistakable to him. Yet To his surprise, she wasn’t alone. A man, very familiar to his eyes, was walking beside her, and as he peered closer, he recognized him suddenly. 

Franz Klauswitz.

Bastian kept watching with growing unease as they engaged in a surprisingly friendly and intimate conversation, his forehead furrowed deeper upon seeing the scene.  Franz was speaking, while Odette listened attentively, beaming into a smile that was far different from the forced one Bastian was accustomed to see that she usually wore.

Bastian had walked past that place countless times without giving it a second thought. But as he watched Franz and Odette engrossed in conversation there, he wondered if it was an art gallery.

His mind drifted back to a memory from long ago, when the delicate snowflakes of spring had fallen silently over a captivating sight.

He had watched as she wandered through the exhibition hall, her eyes shining with excitement and wonder. She had always possessed a keen love for all things beautiful and merry, much like Franz. The similarity had never occurred to him before, but now it seemed so obvious.

Bastian wondered what made her come meet Franz without my permission. He then made a deliberate effort to forget the afternoon when he had counted the shadows of snowflakes on the woman's face while she was lost in the art.

As he descended the last stairway, he suddenly had a change of heart. He now desired to hear the answer to his question directly from Odette herself.

Franz extended what appeared to be a tiny, folded note towards Odette, who had just turned her back. Odette accepted it. Although she got a little hesitant.

She was facing him with her back to Bastian, so he couldn't see her face, but he could tell exactly how Franz was feeling. It was entertaining to watch him become agitated like a puppy who needed to go potty. If his mother had seen it, she would have been sick for days.

Bastian silently, observed his wife increasingly bizarre behavior as she started walking towards the waiting yellow car as the automobile carrying Franz departed the gallery first. She didn't, however, get in the car.

Odette provided the driver with short instructions before embarking on a private stroll along the sun-kissed, glistening street. Her light footsteps caused the hem of her blue skirt to flutter rhythmically. Despite having no inclination towards women's fashion, Bastian could easily identify the garment. It was the exact same dress that Odette had donned for the officers' dinner party.

Bastian gasped with astonishment. He had believed that his wife was quietly following orders, but it was as though he had caught a glimpse of her deep hidden secrets. 

With a flick of his wrist, Bastian elevated the cuffs of his crisp shirt to glance at his watch. His crucial tasks had been completed, leaving him with only one commitment - a dinner engagement. This particular soirée was a gathering of the elite members of the prestigious polo club, who would be congregating to revel in each other's company.

As Bastian meticulously smoothed out his attire, his heart raced with anticipation. Suddenly, he looked up and there she was - Odette, gracefully turning the corner. But just as quickly as she appeared, she vanished into the tranquil serenity of the sun-drenched street, leaving no trace of her presence behind.

Undeterred, Bastian took a deep breath and propelled himself forward, boldly striding into the dazzling abyss of the scorching summer afternoon.



Under the blazing sun, the heat was almost unbearable. But in the cool embrace of the shade, the air was refreshingly pleasant, like a soothing balm for the skin.

Odette unfurled her parasol,  its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the bustling cityscape as she strolled leisurely through the vibrant downtown streets. She casually perused the dazzling show windows, admiring the stunning displays before making her way to the bookstore.

Upon entering, she was greeted by the intoxicating scent of freshly printed books, intermingled with the faint aroma of ink. The golden dust settled around her as she quietly immersed herself among the sea of readers, enjoying the tranquil ambiance of the literary sanctuary.

With a carefully selected book tucked under her arm, Odette hastened towards her pre-arranged destination. She made her way to the open-air café situated on the street corner, a place she was intimately familiar with having visited it in the past to deliver delicate lace.

This was the very spot where she would often pace back and forth, her mind consumed with deep contemplation, before ultimately turning away.

Silently gliding towards Odette's table, the waiter inquired in a hushed tone, "May I inquire if you are accompanied by anyone this afternoon?"

"No, I am here alone." Without hesitation, Odette said.

“Come this way, please.” With a warm and welcoming smile, the waiter beckoned her to follow him, leading her towards a table on the terrace. It was a prime location, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding area.

Odette ordered coffee and a slice of chocolate cake with rich cream and foam after looking over the menu. A knocking sound came from the table as she took the book out of her bag and opened it.

"Hello, my dear, you look absolutely stunning today."

Odette, determined to rebuff his advances, calmly flipped a page in her book, giving the man a clear indication that she was not interested in engaging in conversation. But the man was undeterred, lingering around the table and boldly inquiring, "May I have the pleasure of joining you?"

Thinking on her feet, Odette quickly concocted a lie, informing him that the seat was reserved for her husband. 

“Sorry, but that seat belongs to my husband.”

“Ah, I see.”

To her surprise, the man refused to back down and continued to hover around the table, making it clear that he wasn't going to be dissuaded easily.

“Oh, you…”

Odette's unwanted guest's eyes met Odette's own, and an irrepressible sigh from her lips. She was shocked to see that the man standing in front of her was indeed her husband, Bastian Klauswitz, who had a haughty smirk on his face.


Chapter 39.
Beneath The Thousand-Fold Veil.


The untouched coffee sat on the table, the steam rising from its surface until the abundant bubbles gradually subsided and the liquid cooled to a tepid temperature. Meanwhile, the slice of cake in front of her was in a state of flux, with the chocolate frosting melting into a gooey mess under the heat.

The sight of the cake's slow disintegration and the coffee's undisturbed surface gave her a sense of unease, as if she were seeing the world around her fall apart in slow motion.

Bastian scrutinized the table before slamming his teacup down with a resounding thud. Finally, Odette raised her gaze from her fidgeting fingers to meet his stern gaze.

"Enough with this nonsense, eat," Bastian commanded with a curt gesture towards the untouched coffee and cake.

Odette's eyes widened in shock as she regarded her husband's unexpected appearance. "I never expected to cross paths with you in this way. What brought you here? "She asked, trying to be casual about it.

Her smile faded, showing a trace of uneasiness as she quickly changed the topic in an effort to divert the conversation from any potential tension, as the afternoon sun seeped through the foliage, casting a warm glow on her face.

"I had an appointment nearby. I found you in passing," Bastian said, his eyes studying Odette's face for any sign of discomfort.

"Ah... yes. I see."

"And you? I don't think I've been informed that you'll be coming to Ratz. Am I remembering wrong?"

Odette shook her head in response, “No. I didn’t report anything.”

"What brings you here then?" 

Bastian's pupils shrank. Odette expertly concealed her emotions despite the confusing feeling that she was being reprimanded. 

 "An interior designer asked me to choose several paintings to place on the wall. When I learned that you wouldn't be arriving this weekend, I shifted the timetable up a bit from where it was originally scheduled to be handled next week.” A cunning smile played on Odette's lips as she responded to his question.

"Is that really it, then?“ 

Bastian’s calm and collected demeanor only made Odette more nervous. She fidgeted with the handle of her cup, desperately searching for the right words to say in response to his question.

In the company of Franz, Odette felt more at ease. His words had a cunning edge that often left his opponents bewildered, but she found it much preferable to the suffocating tension that Bastian brought. With Franz, all she had to do was smile and respond accordingly, whereas with her husband, even just his gaze left her feeling powerless and vulnerable.

Odette found this man to be more challenging and unsettling the more time they spent together. She struggled to take even a sip of water because she felt stifled and her nerves were on edge.

“Yes.” Odette ultimately decided to fabricate the truth.

Her refusal to use his brother's half-name only seemed to further enrage Bastian, as he might interpret it as a sign of her foolishly crossing paths with someone from his family.

"I stopped by the art gallery to buy a few paintings and I had some spare time. It's been a long since I've gone out, so it would be a shame not to enjoy it before returning home."

With a confident smile, Odette concealed her unease and nervousness. Although Bastian's intense blue eyes seemed to look right through her soul, she put up with them in silence without trying to avert them.

Bastian wet his lips with half-melted ice water and nodded his head in agreement. In the tense calm, there silence was deafening it could break an iceberg.

He folded his arms casually and looked at Odette. He rested the damp napkin on the table as the sun dipped below the horizon. As the warm glow extended its reach beneath the table, it draped Odette in a deceitful grin, reminiscent of the delicate wedding veil she wore on the solstice day - a smile that was sweet to the eyes but bitter to the heart. 

Evidently, Odette was keen to keep her encounter with Franz a secret. He remembered his butler Lovis, who was concerned about the madam who would be waiting for her husband with sadness, he let out a ridiculous laugh, thinking how deceitful his wife was. 

As he looked upon Odette, a feeling of unease crept into his mind. For the first time, he found himself truly pondering the enigmatic workings of her mind. 

Beneath the veil of solitude and melancholy, she seemed to harbor a hidden avarice - a voracious appetite for something beyond his comprehension. His thoughts swirled with confusion, as he questioned his place in her world and the nature of their relationship. 

Why did she persist in her brazen insolence and contemptuous disdain?

 The answers eluded him, leaving him with a sense of wild bewilderment.

Despite the burning curiosity that surged within him, Bastian held his tongue. He knew that beneath the surface of Odette's enigmatic demeanor lay countless layers of hidden depths. Each veil she wore was merely a mask, a facade designed to shield her true self from prying eyes. With each layer peeled back, another presented itself, as though she reveled in the mystery and intrigue of her own being. Bastian knew that the answer he sought would not come easily, for Odette guarded her secrets with an iron will.

Bastian's gaze flicked to his wristwatch,  "Does your schedule permit any other engagements?" 

The corners of Odette's lips upturned into a serene smile, "No. As we agreed earlier, our meeting with Hans is scheduled for six o'clock sharp in the plaza of City Hall," she replied, her voice imbued with a venomous calm.

"Is there any other matter of business we need to address?" 

Odette shook her head. "No, not really. I've been contemplating a short respite here, but ultimately, I feel drawn back to Ardene," she revealed with a hint of wistfulness in her voice. 

Bastian nodded understandingly before responding with a wry chuckle, "Ah, a break.”

His eyes roamed over the scene before him, and they eventually settled on Odette, who sat across from him with an unread book. The tantalizing aroma of coffee and cake drifted between them, tempting his senses. Yet his attention was drawn to the playground behind her - a vibrant tapestry of colors and shapes that he had meticulously crafted with his own hands. 

"Was it not enough just to have that enormous mansion to yourself to relax and enjoy?" 

Even in the midst of his scathing ridicule, Bastian's tone remained remarkably calm.

"My wife is a very adaptive woman. She was only moving from one cheap rental home to another yesterday, but she apparently became tired of living a life of luxury because she is acting in this way now. “Bastian said in a mocking tone.

"So, are you accusing me now?" 

Odette's forced smile vanished as he nodded in response.

"If you possess the intelligence to comprehend my words, why do you insist on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?"

"Is missing one outing such a heinous mistake that you must insult me in this manner? After all, you broke your promise first, so I simply adjusted my plans accordingly." Odette shouted.

"Do you truly believe that we are on the same level?" Bastian's expression shifted as he let out a soft sigh and furrowed his brow, lost in thought for a split second.  "I paid you a just price, which makes me your employer until the end of our contract."

Odette remained silent, unsure of how to respond.

"Just because you're performing the duties of a wife doesn't grant you the rights of one," Bastian spoke firmly, "If you're here as a servant, then act accordingly. Remember this, and you'll have a relatively comfortable two years. What are your thoughts?"

Again, Odette remained silent, prompting him to demand, "I expect an answer, Odette. Speak up, answer me."

His words sliced through the air like a sharp-edged knife, lashing out at Odette with a cold, emotionless ferocity.

"Understood" Odette replied, finally breaking her long, obstinate silence.

Bastian had no desire to continue the talk despite the irreverent emotion that was visible in her intensely crimson eyes.

"Allow me the pleasure of accompanying you to your awaiting car," he declared, his voice firm and unwavering.

Odette cocked her head slightly, a quizzical expression crossing her features. “If I say that I am capable of going on my own, is that an unworthy response from a servant?”

With a steady gaze fixed on Bastian, Odette summoned the courage to pose a daring question. Though a flicker of pain betrayed her emotions, she refused to let a single word escape her lips.

"It seems you possess a remarkable capacity for judgment," Bastian extended his hand towards Odette, a sardonic smile playing at the corners of his lips.

"I appreciate your kind words," Odette replied, her tone suffused with a mix of exaggerated politeness and a hint of provocative daring. She took his offered hand, gripping it with a firmness that seemed to suggest she was patronizing him.

Bastian grasped hold of the gloved, lace-covered, icy hand tightly. Odette was trembling, and he could feel it through their joined hands. It was a pleasant and a grating feeling all at once. 



The drawn-out dinner had stretched far into the night, long past its usual end time. With a heavy heart, Odette pushed herself up from the table, leaving behind the remnants of her half-eaten meal. Despite knowing that self-care was of the utmost importance in times like these, she couldn't help but feel overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to lift her spirits.

Odette made her way down the hushed hallway, her footsteps slower and more measured than usual. With each step, she felt as though she were a buoy adrift in the vast, open sea, isolated and alone. Yet, even as she meandered through the quiet halls, she knew that her journey was a brief one. In the light of day, the sense of aimlessness that currently plagued her would dissipate like a wisp of smoke, nothing more than a fleeting, idle thought.

"I’ll do it alone, today.” 

With a heavy heart, Odette dismissed the maids who had been trailing behind her, watching her every move with a critical eye. Weary and drained, she dragged her feet across the threshold of her bedroom, the weight of the day bearing down upon her. Though she sensed the maids' disapproving stares burning into her back, she couldn't bring herself to care.

Odette was so exhausted that she wanted to crawl into bed straight away, but she persisted in making her way to the bathroom to take a bath. She gently groomed her hair and changed into a fresh nightgown. She felt much better by the time she stood up with a ribbon attached at the end of her braided hair.

Odette stood motionless, gazing at the entrance to the couple's bedroom with a hollow, vacant expression. A deep, resigned sigh escaped her lips, a physical manifestation of the overwhelming sadness and despair that consumed her.

Though she was wracked with misery and heartache, she refused to place the blame solely on Bastian's shoulders. She had entered into this marriage with full awareness of the challenges that lay ahead, and she was determined to face them head-on. Even though the harsh realities of the situation were far more daunting than she had initially anticipated, Odette knew that this was the best decision she could have made under the circumstances.

 With sheer force of will, Odette fought to keep her mind from succumbing to the overwhelming despair that threatened to consume her. She made her way over to the table, where a pile of mail awaited her attention.

Knowing that retiring to bed in such a despondent state would only make it harder for her to find rest, she resolved to cling to the fleeting glimmers of hope that still remained. She sorted through the odds and ends on the table, refusing to allow herself to become weighed down by the inescapable truth of her situation. After all, she had to make it work, no matter how difficult it might be.

Odette painstakingly read the messages, pulled up her nightgown sleeves, and penned a response. There was a letter from her father among them. It was a letter full of rage and profanity directed at the daughter who had embarrassed the family by getting married to a lowly man.

She dropped the torn letter into the garbage, thinking it was good that he had regained his strength. It was quickly followed by a letter from Sandrine, in which she listed her favorite furnishings, jewelry, plants, and flowers along with her wish list for the garden.

She carefully committed a handful of noteworthy items to memory, then recorded them in her trusty notebook. Among the entries was the name and contact information of the merchant whom Franz had recommended for the finest Felia-made ornaments, which she jotted down just beneath the others.

With nothing else to occupy her thoughts, Odette surrendered herself to the comfort of her bed. As she lay there, the soothing sound of the ocean's gentle waves drifted in through the open window, carried on the cool, nocturnal breeze.

With a determined effort, Odette closed her eyes and banished the image of the repulsive man that had plagued her thoughts. Though the weight of her troubles made her feel ancient beyond her years, she refused to let them consume her.

Slowly but surely, the gentle touch of the moonlight lulled her into slumber. Throughout the long, lonely night, the steady cadence of the waves provided her only solace, and it remained by her side until the first light of dawn crept into the sky.

That's OK. Nothing is wrong. Everything is going to be fine.

A sense of calm washed over her as she repeated the reassuring words to herself, like a soothing melody that brought her solace.


Chapter 40.
Let's make an effort to win this time.


Odette peered through the window nervously as the vehicle descended more into the mountain's interior. Even under the brightest of skies, the dense grove of conifers that surrounded them emanated a foreboding air. In stark contrast to the oppressive heat they had left behind at the mountain's base, a cool breeze whistled through the sky-piercing trees, evoking an unearthly mood.

The hush of the dense forest enveloped them, broken only by the measured hum of the car's engine. Odette's words pierced the stillness like a dagger, infused with caution and uncertainty. "Do we have the right way?" she asked, the first words to escape her lips since their departure from Ardene.

Bastian maneuvered the curving road with ease, his gaze fixed straight ahead and his chin inclined just a little. Odette couldn't help but be annoyed by his callous attitude, as if she were nothing more than an annoying insect, even though she didn't let it show. She told herself, "Don't think about it," and her eyes returned to the world beyond her window.

“Does a villa possibly exist in this area?” Odette wondered to herself. Yet she was skeptical, and decided against asking any more questions. In any way, talking to him seemed totally pointless.

In a blink of an eye, the dreaded weekend had arrived, forcing her to face the man she wished to avoid. However, there was a glimmer of comfort in the fact that they had been invited to the Demels' villa in the neighboring city. This invitation meant that they wouldn't have to endure each other's company for long stretches of time. With this in mind, she believed that she could manage the situation as long as the man cooperated, and she was determined to do her part.

Odette closed the book she had only just begun reading with a quiet sigh. She deeply wished she had a servant with her instead of her so-called husband. Sadly, Bastian had insisted on taking the wheel himself. He claimed that the Demel’s family had enough staff and they didn't need his own vehicle. Consequently, the maid and servant who were prepared to go with them were left behind.

The man in question had led a more aristocratic life than any other aristocrat, yet he possessed a surprisingly unpretentious and pragmatic demeanor. Some ridiculed this as a sign of lowly bloodline, but Odette viewed it as a highly commendable trait. However, her current feelings towards him did not align with this perspective.

"Ohh..."

Odette let out a soft exclamation when their car emerged from the shadowy embrace of the coniferous forest.

Bastian cast a quick glance at his wife, who was hastily rolling down the car window, and was now staring at the Demel family's magnificent villa with a look of rapturous enchantment. The villa was renowned for its breathtaking view, and it seemed that Odette, like many before her, was completely under its spell.

Bastian slowed down the car as they drove down the driveway leading to the villa.

The water's gleaming surface could be glimpsed beyond the rows of birch trees. The villa's most prized possession was a lake that was formed when glaciers melted. The surrounding tall mountains were completely white from the yearly snowfall, which did not melt even in the middle of July.

The colors of objects here seemed especially rich and vibrant, perhaps as a result of the clean air. The fresh greenery, high and blue sky, and warm smile on the cold woman's face all complemented one other.

Odette's protest had been utterly absurd at this point. Bastian let out a laugh at its ridiculousness. It seemed that her objections had melted away like candle’s wax with the appearance of a single, stunning view.

Odette was a fanciful woman who often smiled with an air of pure innocence, much like a child whose eyes gleam with a sense of wonder and amazement, eager to explore and marvel at the world around them. Yet, as always, this flickering light faded as soon Bastian met her eyes. 

With eyes as wide and startled as a rabbit's, Odette quickly averted her gaze from Bastian's. Just then, the car pulled up in front of the villa, where the Demel family's servants were waiting already. 

"Please do your part well today." He said with a serious and intimidating tone.

While preparing to exit the car, Bastian reminded Odette of her role as his wife, chiding her as if scolding an immature child.

"I understand," Odette replied with a hint of defiance. "I'll do my best to be a ruthless winner. But before we begin, I have a question for you, Bastian."

Despite her sharp retort, Odette maintained a facade of polite formality, unwilling to let her guard down.

“Go ahead." 

"Is the advice to win by any means necessary still applicable when the opponent is you?" Odette asked, raising her metaphorical claws once again, though she knew it would be of no use. "I suppose I'll have to rely on you for the answer since I'm not allowed to do the thinking."

Looking at her with an amused and indulgent expression, Bastian laughed at her clumsy attempt to assert herself as an equal opponent, once again.

"Let's make an effort to win this time. It might actually be fun," He replied arrogantly before stepping out of the driver's seat. Just then, the Marquis and Marchioness of Demel emerged, signaling their arrival.

Bastian gave a gentle sigh and courteously opened the passenger's door, gesturing for Odette to take his hand. She followed his lead, perceptive and cooperative as ever.

"You both look absolutely stunning today! Like newlyweds, I must say!" Admiral Demel's laughter boomed through the warm summer air as he observed the couple.

Casting a quick glance at each other, Odette and Bastian beamed with genuine affection, basking in the admiral's compliment.

The couple, newlyweds of only a month, looked every bit like a pair of love-drunk bride and groom. Their appearance perfectly suited their roles, lost in a dreamy state of love and sheer fondness. 



The young Count made a dramatic entrance as the final guest to arrive at the villa. He was accompanied solely by his young daughter, cradled in the arms of her nanny.

Marchioness Demel took the opportunity to introduce Odette to the Count, just as her husband Bastian had gone off hunting with the other guests. The two met in a moment that felt almost cinematic, surrounded by the lush beauty of the villa's surroundings.

In a voice that rang with eloquence, the Marchioness of Demel introduced the Count to Odette. "May I present to you, Count Xanders. A relative of our family and a distinguished scholar who is currently studying botany at the University of Ratz," she said, gesturing towards the young man. She then turned towards the nanny holding the young daughter, "And this is Mrs. Klauswitz, the wife of Captain Klauswitz, a naval hero and my husband's favorite subordinate. They were just recently married last month." With a gracious smile, she brought the three of them together, creating an atmosphere of warmth and camaraderie.

With a gentle smile, Count Xanders greeted Odette and congratulated her on her recent marriage. “Maxime von Xanders. Mrs. Klauswitz, congratulations on your marriage.” His demeanor exuded both intelligence and warmth, making him seem every bit the scholarly gentleman that he was known to be.

“Odette Klauswitz. Thank you, Count.” Odette gave her a greeting that was flawlessly seamless despite the fact that it was a name she was not used to hearing often.

Marchioness Demel guided Count Xanders to the table under the pergola, she gestured for him to take a seat facing Odette. “This way, Maxime,” 

Only when the nanny had left the room with his sleeping daughter and gone into the mansion did the young scholar turn his attention to the tea and snacks, it was clearly visible how much he loved and cared for his daughter.

After a minute of interruption, the conversation around the tea table naturally resumed. Count Xanders, the final person to arrive at the social event after a lengthy absence, served as the topic's main character.

Odette attentively listened to the cheerful chatter around the table while sipping the tea delicately.  It wasn't until Count Xanders mentioned his recent return from an overseas research trip that she realized why his name had been unfamiliar to her in the high society circles of the capital.

"When Maxime returned to Berg, he hardly attended social gatherings, which led to speculations that he might have been afflicted with a serious illness," Marchioness Demel remarked. Count Xanders, when confronted by the Marchioness, merely shook his head with a bashful grin.

"I wanted to prioritize spending time with my young daughter, whom I've been away from for some time. Children grow up so quickly, you see. This time won't come again, so every day is precious and worthwhile." His soothing tone and gentle demeanor radiated comfort and ease reminiscent of a warm summer afternoon, and his eyes, expressions, and subtle movements conveyed the same sentiment.

"Count Xanders has a gentle and charming demeanor," complimented one of the guests.

"He is a wonderful father and sets an excellent example for those who neglect their family duties." The Marchioness added.

Another guest jokingly suggested, "Perhaps we should gather all the hunting party attendees and have Count Xanders give them a lesson on fatherhood."

Count Xanders' ears began to slightly blush as compliments began to flood in from all directions. Odette noticed it and her lips curled into a soft smile. The man, a botanist, exuded a vibe resembling the subject he studied.

Odette lowered her voice, curious about Count Xanders' wife. "But isn't Countess Xanders with him, where is she?" 

The lieutenant colonel's wife, sitting beside her, let out a startled look and slapped Odette on the arm. "Please do not mention the Countess's name. She passed away during childbirth, and it was a great loss for Count Xanders. He went through a lot of pain and grief because he deeply loved his wife. Thankfully, he is finding solace in their daughter, who bears a striking resemblance to her mother."

"Ah, I see..."  Odette's countenance became clouded with shock as she learned of the tragic fate of Countess Xanders. She was at a loss for words, only managing to utter a brief in response to the lieutenant colonel's wife. Just then, the group of hunters returned, their boisterous footsteps shattering the peacefulness of the summer afternoon.

With his hair tousled and sweat dampening his platinum locks, Bastian arrived at the tea table. He flashed a charming smile and extended his hand to Odette, who took it without flinching, despite the lingering scent of animal blood and gunpowder on him.

Marchioness Demel, a skilled hostess, made her way to introduce her guests with a bright smile. "Captain Klauswitz and Count Xanders, I believe this is the first time you two have met?" she inquired.

Bastian Klauswitz extended his hand for a handshake, introducing himself after the hostess's introduction. “Pleased to meet you. I’m Bastian Klauswitz.” 

Although it was considered inappropriate for a person of lower class to initiate a handshake, Count Xanders showed no signs of offense. He appeared to be someone who valued sincerity over formalities. “It's a pleasure to meet the hero you see in the newspapers, Captain Klauswitz.”

Bastian and Count Xanders exchanged pleasantries with a cordial handshake, and the Count expressed his admiration for the heroic feats Bastian had accomplished, as reported in the newspapers. The two men, who hardly resembled one another and appeared to be of another species, had Odette's attention in a blank stare.

Her heart once yearned for a partner as comforting as the sun's warm embrace, a tranquil union akin to a gentle stream flowing peacefully. A love that blossoms from friendship, creating a haven of comfort and solace for each other. But fate had other plans, and she found herself masquerading as the spouse of a man who was the polar opposite of her aspirations.

Odette's eyes darted away, and she felt a peculiar sensation in her chest. The sun was descending behind the towering snow-capped peaks, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink.

As she gazed upon the breathtaking scenery, it dawned on her that she had traveled a great distance to get here. 


Chapter 41.

Appeared Like a Siren.


The raucous melody and merrymaking faded away as Odette ascended to the third floor, where the guest chamber awaited her. 

Guided by a maid, she stepped inside the room located at the eastern end, and though the darkness obscured her sight, she knew that, in the light of day, the bedroom boasted a stunning panorama of the tranquil lake and lush forest beyond the slope.

"I'll manage on my own.” She thanked the maid for helping her get dressed and continued to get ready by herself after that, embracing the pleasure of being independent.

Her head spun slightly from the effects of alcohol, but she was still able to steady herself. As she removed her wedding ring, she stepped into the bathroom and started running the bathwater, its soothing sound echoing through the room.

had she truly been a good wife? 

A wave of doubt washed over her. The bathtub filled with warm water and Odette allowed herself a moment of reflection. She deeply appreciated Marchioness Demel's kindness and hospitality, which had allowed her to play the part of Mrs. Klauswitz in a much more relaxed environment than usual. She had savored the exquisite food and pleasant conversations, free from the usual need for vigilance and tension. It was a break from the constant battle of wits she faced every day.

A sudden thought occurred to her as she struggled to stay awake,. Maybe, just maybe, she could find what she was looking for in Bastian's memories. With determination in her eyes, she delved deep into his mind, sifting through the memories like a detective on the hunt for a clue.

So she worked, and even helped stealing glances at Bastian, afraid he might notice her distraction and admonish her once again for not doing her duty. Despite his stoic demeanor, she sensed his mood shift slightly, perhaps wondering what was going through her mind.

Bastian's warm laughter and soft gazes filled the dining table with light, making Odette feel at ease in his company. As the night drew to a close, it was Bastian who urged Odette to retire to their room, even though he himself had been drinking more than usual.

‘Good night Odette.’

As Odette climbed the stairs, she could still hear the echoes of Bastian's voice 

When she caught his eye, she wondered if his sweet greeting was merely an act. But his smile was genuine, and there was a glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes that she couldn't quite decipher. 

Odette sighed in relief when she came to a rough conclusion and shut off the water. She then noticed the large window that spanned the entire wall past the bathtub.

She glanced through the window with a confused head as she walked over to close the curtains.

The night sky above was a dazzling display of twinkling stars, like a vast ocean above her head. With a sudden impulse, Odette flung open the window, drawn by the mesmerizing beauty of the midsummer night. The Milky Way arched above, accompanied by the rustling whispers of trees and the symphony of insects.

The reason for the large bathroom window finally became clear to her. Odette was enthralled by the enchanting scene for a long while, until she turned away, leaving the window open behind her. With the room dimmed, she shed her gown, ready to slip into the inviting waters of the bathtub.

The ripples ceased, and the bathroom went silent once again.



The haunting howls of coyotes echoed through the dark expanse of the black forest, their calls piercing the stillness of the night.

Bastian halted in his steps and gazed out the window in the hallway, where clusters of stars twinkled in the moonless sky. Memories flooded his mind as he reminisced about the special classes held during nights like these, when the family trained to prepare for unforeseen circumstances and groom a capable successor to lead them into the future.

In the world of immunity-receiving teachers, cruelty was the norm. Yet, a few were exceptions, and their kind-heartedness and deep thinking were rare commodities. Unfortunately, such teachers seldom lasted long.

Bastian's longest-standing teacher was a retired army officer stripped of his rank for his cruel treatment of soldiers. However, to Bastian's father, he was a great mentor. After tearing his gaze away from the dim horizon, Bastian continued on his way. Although he was heavily intoxicated, his judgment remained unimpaired.

The invitation to Admiral Demel's party was always accompanied by the promise of overflowing glasses and bottomless bottles, and Bastian had often succumbed to the temptations of the night. But tonight was different. Tonight, he chose a different path, one that did not lead him to the bottom of the bottle.

He knew that just the right amount of alcohol would lull him into a peaceful slumber, and so he drank enough to take the edge off. As he made his way to his room, a strange sensation crept up his spine. 

Had Odette already gone to bed? 

He hesitated for a moment before quietly pushing open the door.

The lamp on the bedside table cast a warm glow over the empty bed, signaling to him that she was not there. But as he stood there, a sweet melody reached his ears, drawing him in like a siren's call. The sound, a gentle hum, echoed through the darkness like a lullaby. Bastian followed it, his body moving of its own accord, until he stood before the half-open bathroom door.

Without a second thought, he flung the door open, revealing Odette in all her glory. 

In a mesmerizing moment, Bastian realized the source of the haunting melody was none other than Odette. Her enchanting voice echoed through the room like a spell, casting him under its spell. 

As he stood frozen in place, he  gazed upon the breathtaking sight of her, submerged in the bath by the window. She appeared like a siren, tempting him to join her in the cool, clear water. Her song was like a dream, lulling him into a trance. In the darkness, her naked form shone like a beacon, her vulnerability exposed for all to see. Lost in the moment, she remained oblivious to his presence.

Bastian fought back a sudden surge of unease and a feeling of hollowness, balling his hands into fists. And just as he did, a gust of wind swept through the trees beyond the dark forest, causing the leaves to rustle and creating a wave of sound that shattered the silence of the night.

Odette abruptly stopped singing and turned her head, following the direction of the wind. Her eyes locked onto Bastian's, and in that moment, the transparent darkness of the midsummer night seemed to disappear, leaving only the two of them.

But then, fear flashed across her face, and she stared at him blankly. A sharp scream threatened to escape her lips, but Bastian acted quickly, intuited the crisis, and moved to prevent it.

With lightning-fast reflexes, Bastian launched himself towards the bathtub and clamped his hand over Odette's mouth to stifle her scream. Despite her feeble attempts to resist, his   strength easily subdued her. The silence of the midsummer night was restored as the wind that had shaken the forest gradually died down.

Bastian's heart raced as he strained to hear any sign of movement outside the bathroom door. The muffled chatter and laughter of the partygoers slowly faded away, indicating that the night's festivities had finally come to an end.

With a relieved sigh, Bastian turned his attention back to Odette, who was now visibly shaken and as pale as a ghost. It was hard for him to reconcile this vulnerable, frightened woman with the bold and bewitching creature he had encountered just moments before.

His eyes searched for any sign of understanding from her, trying to make sense of the bizarre occurrence. His grip remained firm, ready to act swiftly in case of any sudden movements or surprises.

Odette's body quivered under Bastian's touch, her resistance growing stronger as his gaze trailed down her slender neck, tracing the path of blue veins and down to her clavicle. The drops of water on her heaving chest glistened in the soft light, falling into the still water with a gentle plink. As the noises of the partygoers faded away, Bastian lifted his gaze from her body.

“Shhh.” Bastian gestured to be quiet, placing a finger over his lips.  Odette's eyes widened with fear, but she obediently nodded.

Bastian released his grip on Odette and rose to his feet, with a quick motion, he tossed a towel towards the trembling woman, who eagerly snatched it up and wrapped it around her shivering form. Odette's breaths came in rapid gasps, as if she had just narrowly escaped some great danger.

"What brought you here? Why..." Odette struggled to breathe and stuttered over her words. Bastian greeted her eyes with clear, bewildered eyes, and he soon understood the situation.

“Did you truly believe this room was meant for you alone?" His frustration was tangible, evident in the way he licked his parched lips and let out an exasperated laugh.

"Originally, we..."

"Why don't we inform Admiral Demel, the Emperor's confidant, right away?" Bastian's voice cut through the air, "Dear You Grace. you see, our marriage is a charade. We are merely playing the roles of a married couple, and we don't even share a bed. It would be greatly appreciated if we could have another room, separate from each other. Could that be arranged?"

"I'm……sorry," Odette's voice trembled as she spoke, "I had hoped that you would find a solution to our problem, but... I was wrong." her voice laced with tears and barely audible in the darkness. 

Her hand shook as she reached up to wipe her flushed face, as if trying to snap out of her daze, but it seemed to have little effect.

"Clean up and come out." Bastian exited the bathroom and shut the door behind him, finally catching sight of his own disheveled, damp appearance.

After hastily patting himself dry, he stepped out onto the balcony for a smoke. As he exhaled a cloud of white smoke, his gaze drifted downwards and he realized that his arousal had not yet abated.

With a wry laugh, Bastian released another plume of smoke and let out a mix of a sigh and a curse.


Chapter 42.
A cunning and ruthless victor.



A melody of nature resonated through the air as the trees rustled and swayed to the rhythm of the wind.

Odette's eyes fluttered up and her chest jumped up and down quickly as she emerged from the depths of her dreadful nightmares. She wasn't aware of her surroundings or where she was till the sleepiness subsided for a short while.

Her lips parted with a gentle exhale, a quiet admission of her unintended slumber. She shifted her gaze towards the bed on the opposite end of the darkened room. She found Bastian lying, still and serene, in the same supine posture as before.

Odette released the tension that had held her captive, rising from her chair with a hushed step. With a soft touch, she drew the curtains closed, cutting off the intrusive moonlight. She swiveled on her heel, her eyes drawn to the clock that loomed on the wall opposite. The hands seemed to have crawled across the face of time at a glacial pace, and despite the seemingly endless wait, it was still the dead of night. A few more moments of patience were required before the world awoke from its slumber.

Odette's eyes remained fixated on the deserted expanse of the left side of the bed, her heart thrumming with unease. Though it had been allotted to her by Bastian, the thought of invading his space was daunting, leaving it a hollow shell of what it could be.

Bastian's composure remained unchanged as he finished his nightly routine, slipping into bed without sparing even a single glance in her direction. She felt like a prisoner, trapped and isolated within the confines of their shared space. As though he had erased her very existence, leaving behind only a ghostly apparition of a fake so called wife.

Bastian, unpredictably, refused to acknowledge it as a trouble.

Determined to banish her doubts, Odette steeled herself and approached the bed. The dawn was luxuriously chilly, even amidst the sweltering heat of summer in the mountainous region.

She chided herself for lingering in fear, especially when she had the luxury of a safe haven to rest in. It was pointless to fret and stew over the mistake that had already been made. Perhaps she should take a page out of Bastian's book and be bold in her actions.

Odette worked up the confidence to sit on the side of the bed, determined to forget everything at this moment. Thankfully, Bastian did not awaken. 

Even while sleeping, he was charming.

His forehead was covered in golden thread-like hair, and his eyelashes were long and straight. He had an old scar below his collarbone.

Her scrutinizing gaze locked onto his hand, lingering on the glittering platinum ring that rested upon his chest. It was the emblem of their fraudulent marriage, a stark reminder of the deceit that they had woven.

Overwhelmed with a sudden wave of shame, Odette recoiled and fled from the bed as if running from a nightmare. Her hands, adorned with the same ring as Bastian's, felt foreign and heavy as she buried them behind her back. 

It was akin to the feeling she had experienced years ago, on a bright spring day when she had first set out to peddle her wares of delicate lace. The memories flooded back with unwelcome clarity, threatening to swallow her whole.



Bastian stirred just as the first rays of dawn crept over the horizon, heralding the start of a new day.

Regardless of when he had turned in for the night, he awoke with the same unwavering consistency each morning. It was a routine that had been honed and refined over the years. 

Without a moment's hesitation, Bastian rose from his slumber as the grogginess dissipated, his eyes scanning the empty expanse of the bed beside him.

The realization struck him like a bolt of lightning: 

Odette was not there.

Bastian delicately shut his eyes and then swiftly opened them, hastily rising from the bed. The seat where Odette had perched just the night before remained unoccupied. The seething fury that had previously consumed him at the mere notion of the woman who had fled from this very room dissipated into nothingness.

As he made his way towards the wardrobe to change, he discovered his wife reclined on a lengthy sofa, her face directed towards the fireplace. Odette lay there, enveloped in unfamiliar furniture covers, slumbering in a tightly coiled position. 

Bastian gazed upon the pathetic sight, feeling a sense of confusion wash over him. Against the coldness of the room, he realized that she had not sought comfort beside the man she held in contempt. 

The sheer audacity of her pride evoked a laughter from him.

Odette, 

A name that Bastian had known all too well for far too long. He swallowed the bitter taste of it on the tip of his tongue, approaching her reclined figure on the sofa with cautious steps. He knew it was best to rouse her and send her off to bed, but he couldn't help but doubt whether Odette would comply without resistance.

With a heavy heart, Bastian let out a low sigh and gradually leaned in closer to his slumbering wife. Just as he began to lift the covers off of her, Odette's eyes flickered open, startling him from his thoughts.

"Stay put, don’t move," Bastian spoke in a composed tone as he lifted her frigid form.

For a moment, Odette gazed at Bastian with hazy eyes before launching into an intense struggle. Though she refrained from screaming, she pushed and writhed with all her might, as if Bastian had committed an unspeakable offense against her. Fortunately, she didn't lack the sense to raise a ruckus.

"Calm down." Bastian spoke in a stern tone, but his wife paid no heed. 

Growing increasingly irritated by her stubbornness and unyielding nature, Bastian clambered over the body of the woman he had just released. With a steely resolve, he grasped her arms and forcefully pinned them down onto the sofa, finally bringing an end to her senseless resistance.

Despite trembling with fear, Odette's frigid stare never wavered as she locked eyes with him.

"I don't want you here! Get off!" she gasped, struggling for breath and issuing a scathing command.

Bastian gradually lowered his head, meeting the unwavering gaze of the formidable woman beneath him. It was a sight to behold as her cheeks burned crimson, her hair tousled and her bosom heaving with ragged breaths.

"What's so amusing?" Bastian chuckled as he restrained Odette, who was writhing with all her might.

Overwhelmed by the sheer might and his power, Odette was struck silent, her lips pursed tightly shut. As his body pressed against hers, it sent shivers down her spine, and his piercing gaze made her feel utterly exposed, as though she were standing naked before him.

"Enlighten me. What was it that I intended to do?" 

Bastian inquired. Despite attempting to lift her legs in lieu of her bound arms, Odette was swiftly overpowered by him. As she wriggled beneath him, she was taken aback by the unfamiliar sensations coursing through her tightly pressed lower body, causing her to shake her head frantically in denial.

"I won't do anything, anything that isn't agreed to in the contract!" Odette exclaimed vehemently.

"You're mistaken, Odette. Despite your reluctance, I am your husband, and that is the essence of our contract," 

"It was you who presented the contract on the premise that our marriage was nothing more than a sham!" Odette's voice rose in pitch with each passing word. Despite the hushed silence that pervaded the entire third floor, it was only a matter of time before the guests would awaken.

Bastian placed one hand on the sofa's armrests and gently squeezed Odette's hands together. As he gripped her chin with his other hand, a loud moan escaped her mouth.

"Please keep your word."

 With an expression that betrayed her desperation, Odette pleaded with Bastian to honor his commitment. But Bastian's features remained stern and his lips formed a cruel smile. The marriage had to proceed as agreed, that much was clear to him. He had no intention of deviating from their contract. Once his dealings with the emperor were concluded, he would discard her like a used tissue and move on to bigger and better things.

Bastian let out a deep, intense breath as he gripped Odette's chin firmly.

Since the day they met, he knew that she was meant to be his, despite the reasons that led to their marriage. Therefore, until the end of their agreement, he had every right to claim what was rightfully his.

In his eyes, she was nothing more than a tool, a pawn in his grand scheme. He had given her everything she had, and she owed him everything. If he decided to be cruel and show her no mercy, he had every right to do so. He knew that the concept of favor was fickle and superficial, and he had no intention of being swayed by it.

“If you don't move straight away, I'll scream.” 

As the sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway, Odette felt a wave of panic wash over her. Desperate for a way out, she resorted to making empty threats, hoping to intimidate Bastian into moving. However, little did she know that Bastian was one step ahead of her, fully aware of her intentions. 

“Give it a try.”

Bastian responded to Odette's challenge with an arrogant laugh, completely unfazed. 

As she glared at him with contempt, their distance dwindled to nothing. Before she could even react, she felt his hot breath on her lips and his tongue pushing into her mouth, overwhelming her with a sudden, unexpected desire.

Odette fought valiantly, having lost even the little bits of dignity she had been barely preserving.

Damn the deal, she thought to herself. 

She might have screamed for assistance. Whatever she desired. She ought to have. But Odette couldn't even breathe properly, let alone scream.

Bastian sucked Odette's lips and twisted his tongue as though trying to take everything away while enclosing her beneath his big, muscular body. 

The kiss was just like a predator stalking its prey. Intense and passionate.

Despite being in a state of distress, Odette summoned all her strength and twisted her body as Bastian was momentarily distracted. 

With her hands finally freed from bondage, she fiercely pushed him away, landing punches and scratching him. However, even after the fierce confrontation, Bastian remained unmoved.

Just as Odette was on the verge of despair and feeling helpless, Bastian's lips suddenly parted from hers. Seizing the moment, she let out a cry of indignation and injustice before delivering a swift slap across his face,

Slap!

 The resounding sound echoing through the room.

Odette glared up at him with fury, her hands trembling from the adrenaline. Against the stinging sensation on her lips, she refused to back down. 

Bastian couldn't help but feel foolish for underestimating her. He leaned back, running his fingers through his hair as he contemplated his mistake. It was clear that he had underestimated the strength and tenacity of his so-called "wife."

Bastian chuckled, finding the defeated yet determined look on Odette's face amusing. It was refreshing to see her finally embracing the art of strategy, like a true Klauswitz. 

Despite the unsuccessful attempt to strike him again, Bastian found her tenacity intriguing. It certainly made his job more captivating.

Catching the wrist he had grasped at once, Bastian devoured Odette's lips again with even more fury. Much resistance followed, but Bastian eventually lost patience with it.

Bastian grabbed hold of Odette's breasts without hesitation, shoving his hand inside her pyjamas, which had already rolled up to her waist. His tongue crushed and absorbed Odette's screams and moans.

Odette's body trembled as she tried to suppress her cries. Everything was a blur, and she couldn't comprehend what was happening. But amidst the confusion, one thing was crystal clear - Bastian's desire for her. It radiated off him like a palpable force, overpowering and all-consuming. 

Bastian's hand suddenly crept inside her underpants just as it got too painful to bear. She wasn't aware of what was happening until he began lewdly stroking her inner thighs.

Odette was caught off guard, unsure of what to do next, and closed her eyes in shock. She reprimanded herself, trying not to cry, and begged for divine guidance, pleading for clarity of thought. However, the sound of Bastian's lecherous actions continued to increase in volume, making it almost impossible for her to concentrate.

“Bastian.”

As Bastian's lips met hers once more, Odette summoned her courage and dared to open her eyes. She was met with the cool, collected gaze of Bastian's piercing blue eyes.

“Bastian.” 

As the commotion outside the room grew louder, Odette clung onto Bastian's face, tears streaming down her cheeks as she whispered his name. Their gaze locked onto each other, but the noise from the corridor continued to seep into the room, threatening to disrupt their moment.

“Help me out.” 

Odette's voice shook with desperation as she spoke. Despite the fact that he was the one causing her distress, he was still the only one she could turn to for help.

“Bastian, please… help me.”

 She squeezed her eyes shut, struggling to keep her composure amidst the chaos that surrounded them. 

The noise from outside the door threatened to overwhelm her, but she clung to the hope that Bastian would hear her plea and come to her aid.

A boisterous, hearty laugh pierced through the tense silence, sending shivers down her spine. The sound of heavy footsteps followed, indicating the arrival of a large and powerful man. 

Bastian's response was a mirthful chuckle laced with profanity as he rose to his feet. The room was suddenly illuminated by a stream of sunlight, casting an unflattering light on Odette's disheveled and quivering form.

Bastian carelessly threw the furniture covers onto the ground beside Odette, who was still shaking from the recent encounter. He could still smell her arousal on his fingers as he wiped his moist lips, feeling a mixture of satisfaction and disgust.

He pulled down Odette's gown, which had been pushed up to her waist, and rose from the couch, not bothering to glance at her. As he left, he couldn't help but think about his wife, who had proven to be a cunning and ruthless victor.


Chapter 43.
Leash of Fraudulent Agreement.



The visitors split into two separate groups as they approached the forest's entrance. The women and kids travelled down the valley on a lovely excursion with plans to enjoy a delightful picnic while the men, commanded by Admiral Demel, set off on a fishing expedition to catch some trout.

"Exercise caution and be mindful of your steps. We don't want to lead our guests into a treacherous terrain," advised Marquis Demel before venturing into the enchanting birch forest with his entourage.

Standing at the far end of the group, Bastian and Odette gave each other a quick glance before dispersing. No special words were exchanged, as usual, only lifeless emotions portrayed their face.

“Father!”

A child's breathless scream shattered the peaceful ambiance of the forest path. It was the voice of Count Xanders' young daughter, who had let out a piercing cry that reverberated through the woods. The serene ambience of the forest trail was abruptly disrupted by the piercing cry of a breathless child. It was none other than the young daughter of Count Xanders, who had let out an alarming scream that echoed through the woods.

Bastian swiveled his head towards the source of the commotion and saw the child, who had become separated from her father, sobbing uncontrollably, as if her entire world had come crashing down.

It was common for children to cry and seek comfort, so he wasn't particularly surprised by the sight of Count Xanders running towards his weeping daughter. However, the tender display of affection between father and child was foreign to him, having grown up without experiencing it himself.

Count Xanders immediately took charge of the situation, comforting his child with tender care. He held her close, showered her with affectionate kisses, and wiped away her tears with the corner of his sleeve, a heartwarming sight that left Bastian feeling somewhat envious.

The child's cries gradually stopped, making it appear as though Count Xanders' persuasive words had worked like magic. Her small hands, which had held tenaciously to her father's collar, continued to hold on in an apparent attempt to find solace and certainty.

As a hint of embarrassment crept over Count Xanders' face, Odette stepped in, bringing a bright ray of hope, who stepped forward with an air of confidence. She deftly plucked a vibrant wildflower and approached the father and daughter with a gentle smile on her lips.

As soon as she handed the flower to the child, a sudden burst of joy erupted from within the little one, and she began to wave it back and forth gleefully. In the meantime, Odette gave yet another hidden flower from behind her back, holding it out with grace and elegance.

One by one, the flowers kept coming, each one more beautiful than the last, until the entire family was surrounded by a glorious bouquet of wildflowers that seemed to dance and sway to an invisible tune. Count Xanders but felt immensely grateful for Odette's kindness, which had transformed a moment of embarrassment into a dazzling display of beauty and joy magically.

Odette kept displaying each vibrant flower, and the child's giggles grew louder and more exuberant, her laughter echoing through the forest like a sweet melody. By the time the last flower was offered, all eyes were fixed on Odette, who become the center of attention.

Seizing the opportunity, Odette tenderly embraced Count Xanders' daughter, whose beaming smile revealed a newfound happiness that seemed to have eclipsed her father's absence. After expressing his profound gratitude, Count Xanders bid farewell to the group and returned to his fishing expedition, while Odette and the child made their way back, hand in hand.

As they walked, Odette's once-icy demeanor melted away, replaced by a gentle smile that radiated warmth and kindness. For a brief moment, the forest was filled with a sense of peace and contentment, as if everything in the world was right and good.

Count Xanders approached with an apologetic smile on his face, his eyes skimpy a hint of discomfort. "I apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you unintentionally," he said. "My daughter is shy and anxious, but it seems she has taken a liking to Mrs. Klauswitz."

Bastian nodded in understanding, his lips curving ever so slightly to convey his empathy. He could sense that Count Xanders was a loving father who cared deeply for his daughter, despite his initial reluctance to join the group. As the two men exchanged a brief moment of mutual respect, the forest around them seemed to breathe life, becoming alive with a newfound sense of camaraderie and understanding.

They soon came across a rocky byway. At the very end of the trail stood Admiral Demel's fishing location.

The road grew steeper and narrower as they ascended higher. The soldiers had no trouble ascending the mountain, but nobles who were unfamiliar with the environment naturally lagged behind.

As the lagging guests struggled to keep up, Admiral Demel leaned in and issued a secret order to Bastian. "You must help Count Xanders," he whispered urgently, his eyes betraying a sense of concern. "He has asthma."

Bastian turned his head to look at Count Xanders, who had fallen out of rank, wheezing and gasping for breath. Despite his initial hesitation to join the group, it was clear that the Count was in dire need of assistance, and Bastian knew he had to act fast. With a sense of urgency in his step, he rushed over to the Count's side, ready to offer whatever help he could.

Bastian began speaking up, concerned. "Then perhaps he shouldn't be forced to climb the mountain," he suggested, eyeing Count Xanders with a worried expression.

But Admiral Demel was quick to dismiss his concerns. "His symptoms are not very severe. Besides, he came here for an important purpose, so he won't give up easily."

"Another purpose besides fishing?" Bastian wondered what other motives Count Xanders might have had for joining the group, especially if he was willing to risk his health to achieve them.

Admiral Demel chuckled and shook his head. "Maxime is not interested in fishing in the slightest. Instead, he has a passion for flowers and grasses. In fact, there is a habitat of rare plants on this mountain that he's hoping to collect samples from. He's quite the character, a really nice guy, but definitely eccentric."

"We should make sure that Maxime doesn't feel embarrassed during the climb. I'll speak with him to ensure that he won't have to be carried on anyone's back."

Despite how awful the assignment was, Bastian was happy to accept it. He complied because he was told to do so. There was no reason to allow other ideas or feelings to influence such a straightforward situation.

As Bastian resumed his journey, Count Xanders offered an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry for the trouble,".

"Shall I lend you a hand with your baggage?"

Bastian offered his assistance, but Count Xanders declined the offer with a wave of his hand, "No need, it's not that heavy. Your company is more than enough." And with that, he strode ahead while Bastian adjusted his pace to match his. The two men talked quite briefly as they proceeded down the mountain trail.

Count Xanders had a pretty dignified and polished way of speech, in contrast to his reputation as a plant-obsessed weirdo. Politics, the financial market, and sports. Also, he had more than a basic understanding of topics related to men's social abilities. Despite all that, He obviously didn't appear interested in anything at all. 

“Wait!” Count Xander screamed out as he was moving along and gazing at the ground.

Bastian paused after scowling. Count Xanders hurried over and knelt down at the same instant. He was directly in front of a small patch of grass on the road that Bastian had nearly crushed.

With a small shovel in hand and a bag slung over his shoulder, Count Xanders carefully dug up a patch of grass. Despite his otherwise reserved demeanor, his expression betrayed a sense of excitement and triumph as he revealed his discovery. "No matter how much I looked for it, I couldn't find it, but here it is," he exclaimed.

"Is this the plant you were searching for?"

"No, but it is just as invaluable." Count Xanders delicately removed the dirt from the roots and used a clean paper to wipe them. With great care, he wrapped the grass and packed it.

When Bastian arrived at the valley where they planned to go fishing, his goal was completed.

Count Xanders graciously thanked everyone and then departed to find the target plant. While he appeared to be fatigued, he would occasionally gasp for air, but even then, his upright stance remained unaltered.

Bastian sat on a rock beneath a canopy of larch trees. Suddenly he got a feeling of déjà vu.

Here was where the water that flowed through the narrow valley began to collect. Why did he feel like he had seen this before?

As Bastian's fingers curled around the fishing rod, the answer to a lingering question sprang to mind like a fish leaping out of the water. And with a jolt, he echoed the name "Odette," his head swiveling towards some unseen presence.

With a steadfast determination, Count Xanders roamed the hillside in search of blades of grass. Along the way, he had traversed a path from apathy towards his fellow beings to a genuine fondness and devotion to things of little practical value. Indeed, Maximin von Xanders bore a striking resemblance to his beloved wife, Odette - a fact not lost on those who knew them both.

Bastian's eyes fluttered open when the image of Odette lying on the sofa with the furniture covers draped over her filled his mind. But what caught his attention were the blindingly dark green eyes that stared back at him, as if daring him to relive the memories that haunted him.

Memories flooded in - the feeling of filth that had washed over him as he looked down at her, the tingling sensation that still lingered even now. But he refused to let them consume him. He then hurled the fishing line out into the water, as if casting away the thoughts that threatened to drag him under.

The valley was filled with the sound of unrelenting river flow and wind rustling through the trees. His pointless recollections quickly vanished after that enlivening event.



"Can you believe it?" Marchioness Demel scoffed, her tone laced with disbelief. "He claimed he was weary of the water, yet he up and moves to a villa nestled deep in the mountains, where he spends his days fishing and boating. The man hasn't the slightest clue what he truly wants." She shook her head, her expression a mixture of exasperation and amusement. "It's a wonder he hasn't driven himself mad with all this indecisiveness."

When the words of criticism for her husband spilled from her lips, the Marchioness Demel's countenance remained awash with deep-seated affection. This was a familiar sight, as even the most esteemed ladies of the court engaged in verbal skirmishes over the shortcomings of their own spouses. 

Odette, meanwhile, found solace in the pleasant chatter as she cradled a child in her arms, offering soothing comfort. While Alma struggled to keep her eyes open, eager to continue playing, she eventually succumbed to slumber's embrace.

"Mrs. Klauswitz possesses a remarkable gift for tending to children. It's evident that you have the makings of a fine mother," remarked one of the noble ladies, causing the attention of the group to shift suddenly towards Odette. The earlier tales of marital discord and discontentment paled in comparison to the prospect of discussing motherhood and child-rearing skills.

"Let's pause here and take a breather. Please, go ahead," Marchioness Demel gestured, prompting the nanny who had been waiting nearby to approach.

Odette handed the baby over, not being able to hold on any longer, while the noble women were having tea while sitting by the ravine.

"Lady Klauswitz and her husband are both wonderful individuals, and I'm sure they will bring a beautiful child into this world," One of the Lady commented with a warm smile

"My husband is already vying to be the godfather of the Klauswitz's unborn child. It's quite embarrassing, really," Another noble lady added with a chuckle.

"As for me, I shall make room for the grandparents of the child-to-be. Both my son and daughter-in-law are eagerly anticipating parenthood, Mrs. Klauswitz," Someone chimed in.

The playful jabs directed at the new bride were met with raucous laughter from the group.

Odette's head hung low, an awkward smile playing across her lips. The words of praise she had received had been delivered with such ease, yet they left her feeling self-conscious. Was it due to that regrettable incident?

Desperate for respite, Odette left the uncomfortable scene and wandered over to a group of young wives frolicking in the water. Unconsciously, she began to make her way up the valley in search of a quiet spot.

But the more she tried to push the memory aside, the more it nagged at her. Questions about the man she couldn't quite comprehend flooded her mind, refusing to be ignored.

Odette ventured deeper into the wilderness and the distant murmur of human voices faded into silence. Gasping for air, she collapsed onto a flat rock overlooking a breathtaking valley, her heart pounding with the thrill of quest.

But her exhilaration was short-lived, as she was forced to endure the vicious insults of a man who treated her like a mere possession, bought and sold at an exorbitant price. Despite her compliance, she seethed with a fiery indignation, vowing to never forget the injustice done to her.

Finally, as she rubbed her lips in frustration, she realized that her rage would not be quenched until she had exacted her revenge on the callous, unscrupulous man who had betrayed her trust.

Despite the turmoil raging within her, Odette bore her anguish in silence, knowing deep down that Bastian's words held a painful truth. Their relationship was a farce, a mere charade of meaningless transactions and empty promises.

But as she pondered the broken promises and heartless betrayal, a flicker of anger ignited within her. Why was he so brazenly defying his own word, and treating her with such disdain?

Odette rubbed her lips, trying to erase the memory of his treachery like a stubborn stain. Yet, the more she tried to forget, the more the feeling of inexpressible contempt grew within her, fueling her determination to seek retribution for the hurt he had caused.

On the evening of the dinner party, Sandrine said young men craved that sort of pleasure. Even the way she spoke with fake sympathy and the way her eyes treated her like a prostitute selling her body. Odette remembered everything vividly at that very moment.

"There she is. The courtesan," 

Odette's heart sank as she heard the cruel words uttered by Princess Isabelle ringing in her memory.  Though her words had been skillfully cloaked in clever guise, the message had been clear - She was nothing more than a mere courtesan, an object to be used and discarded at the whim of the nobility.

When her lips began to tremble ever so slightly, Odette strained them in an attempt to suppress the feeling. Although it wasn't the first time she experienced this, she felt more wretched than she had the first time, for reasons unknown to her. 

In an act of frustration, she hurled her foolish thoughts away, tossing them into the void alongside a fallen pine cone. And as acorns and pebbles followed suit, she wondered if this symbolic act would bring her any sort of relief.

Odette got down and cleansed her face after the water's ripples stopped. Her awareness became more distinct, possibly as a result of the cooling of the heat on her cheeks. Perhaps that was a wise move.

With her breathing finally steady, she sauntered towards the valley's abundant flora, her steps now much lighter than before. Though it would have been easy to simply claim she was gathering flowers, Odette felt no need to make excuses for her wandering. 

Blue irises and golden seaweed bloomed alongside white briar and vibrant wild roses. But it was the sight of a cluster of bellflowers on the far end of the valley that truly caught her attention. It was a bloom she longed to share with the child, and so she made her way towards it with a sense of purpose.

With no faint trace of hesitation, Odette swiftly shed her shoes and stockings before gathering the hem of her skirt and pulling it up to her knees. Despite the sweltering heat of midsummer, the water flowing through the valley was frigid, akin to a frozen glacier. Yet, the cold was far from intolerable, and Odette found herself totally unbothered.

Odette carefully stepped into a shallow area of the water. When she got to the centre of the stream, she heard what sounded like something dropping.

As soon as she realized the lock had been tampered with, she wasted no time diving beneath the surface in search of her prized possession. A wave of relief washed over her as she spotted the necklace adorned with a stunning rose crystal pendant, resting just a short distance away. 

However, before she could even take a step towards it, a figure emerged from the water, snatching the necklace up with a swift motion. 

With wide, startled eyes, Odette looked on as her supposed spouse, Bastian, stood before her, holding her leash under the guise of their fraudulent agreement.


Chapter 44.
Like a flower in the current.


Bastian’s eyes stole a captivating sight when descended down the trail towards the valley. He saw a beautiful woman stood knee-deep in the rippling waters of the ravine, drawing his attention away from his intended destination. 

He pondered what she could be doing there, completely unaware of everything around her. Little did he know, it was none other than Odette, the enigmatic woman soon to enthrall his every thought and imaginations.

Like a jolting force beyond his control, Bastian's eyes darted and his feet carried him forward, leading him straight to her mesmerizing gaze. His feeble attempted to resist, but he found himself standing before her in a state of complete surrender. 

At the meantime, he deeply felt a sense of foolishness, realizing how powerless he truly was in the face of her captivating presence. As their eyes locked, he saw her fingers quivering, betraying the façade of composure she had so expertly crafted.

The gentle breeze had ceased its playful dance, yet the delicate petals of her untamed floral collection continued to sway in sync. Clutching her skirt in her other hand, Odette stood poised, searching for something valuable in the distance. Bastian felt mixture of amusement and annoyance at the sight of his wife trembling as if anticipating an imminent attack from untamed creatures.

As soon as he approached the edge of the valley, the gentle murmur of the nearby stream filled his ears. But his attention was quickly diverted as he caught sight of Odette frozen in a moment of panic. With her delicate form delicately balanced over the glistening stream, her eyes were fixated on something that had slipped from her grasp.

Without a second thought, Bastian plunged into the refreshing waters with a powerful splash. The cool liquid enveloped his body, invigorating his senses as he scanned the depths for any sign of Odette's lost treasure. But his sharp eyes quickly locked onto the shining beacon that had eluded her, a breathtaking rose-colored gem that seemed to glow with its own radiance.

"Hey there, Captain Klauswitz! It seems you couldn't wait for the fish to bite, and decided to reel yourself in for the day and run to your lovely wife," quipped Admiral Demel, his boisterous laughter echoing through the forest.

The sound of raucous merriment carried up the winding hiking trail, heralding the arrival of Demel and his entourage of high-ranking Navy officials. 

With a brief silent bow in response, Bastian moved towards his stiff wife. He considered giving the necklace back to her and walking away, but it didn't seem like a wise move at the time.

"Be cautious, for there are many eyes upon us," cautioned Bastian, his voice a low and urgent murmur as he leaned in towards Odette. She recoiled in surprise, startled by his sudden proximity and the gravity of his words.

Odette found herself trapped in a binding contract, and Bastian knew all too well that escape was not an option, no matter the consequences, even if he were to break all his promises.

She stood at the edge of a precarious precipice, torn between the drive to secure the financial guarantee promised to her and the overwhelming sense of duty and responsibility she felt towards her own life. The stakes were high, and the slightest misstep could spell disaster.

Though the temptation to cause a commotion and flee was great, Odette refused to succumb to the irrational urge. Her attachment to life and the weight of her responsibility were too strong, and she knew that only by standing firm and facing her fears could she emerge victorious from this perilous situation.

With a gentle touch, Bastian clasped the necklace around her neck, the open locking ring glittering in the soft light. Despite the fear and antipathy that she conveyed, his will was unshakable, and her emotions were not a factor to be considered.

For in this marriage, the dominant force was him, the powerful one who did as he pleased. And in exercising his right to rule, he showed no mercy, for he was beholden only to his own desires.

As the silly jokes and laughter of onlookers drifted on the cool breeze, Bastian reveled in his triumph, savoring the sense of control that he held over his wife. 

Odette was filled with a sense of overwhelming despair as she struggled to endure this unbearable moment. Despite her best efforts to resist, all she could manage was a resentful glare towards Bastian, whose face betrayed neither guilt nor remorse for his past outrageous actions.

His piercing blue eyes locked onto hers, devoid of any hint of emotion or feeling. They seemed to bore into her soul, rendering her powerless and helpless to resist his unyielding will.

Just as Odette felt as though she could no longer bear the intensity of Bastian's unwavering gaze, the locking ring on the necklace finally snapped into place, releasing her from the torturous ordeal. With a sigh of relief, she gasped for breath, her body trembling with the weight of the moment.

But as she struggled to regain her composure, another group of guests suddenly appeared on the trail, disrupting the fragile peace that had settled upon them. And in that moment of chaos, Bastian's hand slowly swept down the nape of her neck, tracing the contours of her skin until it found the pendant where her heart beat fiercely.

Overcome with a sudden surge of emotion, Odette pushed Bastian away with all her might, unable to bear the intensity of his touch any longer.

When the wind picked up, the wildflower bouquet slipped from her grasp, its delicate petals scattering across the flowing stream. Her skirt fluttered in the gusts, threatening to drag her off balance and send her tumbling into the icy waters below.

But Bastian remained unmoved, a pillar of unyielding strength amidst the tempestuous currents. Only Odette faltered, her footing slipping beneath her as she stumbled towards the brink of disaster. In that moment of crisis, his sturdy arms wrapped around her back, holding her fast and saving her from the ignominy of a humiliating plunge.

Yet even as she clung to him for support, Odette wondered if his intrusion was a blessing or a curse.

“Oh…. .” 

Odette watched with despair as the bouquet of flowers was carried away by the water's current.

The surface of the water sparkled with a myriad of colors as the carefully collected flowers danced and twirled in the gentle current. Odette watched, transfixed, as they swirled and eddied, each one a fleeting vision of beauty.

But as the last flower disappeared from view, she was left staring blankly across the stream, lost in thought. Beside her, Bastian's gaze was also fixed on the water's edge, his arms wrapped tightly around her in a protective embrace.



In the days that followed, Odette often found herself returning to that fateful day, etched in her memory like a vivid dream. 

The afternoon sun had cast its warm glow over the summer forest, the sound of rushing water filling her ears with its endless song.

Amidst the vibrant colors of the flowers and the crystalline clarity of the water, she had felt a sense of peace and wonder that she had never known before. But as the memory faded, one thing remained clear - Bastian, the enigmatic man who had left an indelible mark on her soul.

This misunderstanding would eventually pass away to the other side of life, just like the flowers that had floated away in the river.

Odette was enveloped by a sense of familiarity and comfort when she suddenly opened the door to her small study. This was her only sanctuary, a place where she could escape from the chaos of the reality life and find solace in her work.

The interior decoration of the room was a evidence to her refined tastes and Sandrine's careful attention to detail. Completed just a week after her return from the Demel's residence, it was adorned with classical landscape paintings and delicate Pelia ornaments, reflecting Sandrine's request to some extent.

Seated at her desk, facing the painting she had personally selected, Odette delved into the head maid's work report. As she pored over the details of the household's affairs, she found peace and solace in the familiar routine of her work. And though the world outside may have been in turmoil, she knew that she had a space to retreat, a refuge from the storm and hurricanes.

With the dwindling number of guests, Ardene's daily life became increasingly monotonous. Save for the weekends when Bastian came to visit, she spent most of her time alone in the villa, immersed in the routine of her work and the quiet solitude of her thoughts.

Occasional visits from her relatives provided a fleeting break from the tedium, but they were few and far between. Outings were kept to a minimum, a decision that shehad made in a moment of lucidity, realizing that contact with the outside world should be reduced as much as possible.

Two months had already passed since the wedding, and soon the short summer of Berg would come to an end, giving way to the cool, windy season. With each passing day, the inexorable march of time carried them forward towards an uncertain future.

And though the next summer would surely come, and the summer after that, she knew that their marriage was not meant to last. 

Odette recognized that two years might not be all that long, and she became a little more careful. It was now time for her to take care of herself because the amicable newlyweds had had enough of being treated rudely. To lessen the effects of their divorce, it was the correct thing to do.

"The furniture for the solarium will be arriving this afternoon," the maid reported.

"Excellent work, Dora. You may take a break now," Odette smiled kindly and acknowledged the report, giving the maid permission to rest and recharge.

As the maid stepped back, Odette turned her attention to the stack of mail on her desk, her eyes falling upon a letter from Tira.

While sipping her tea,  she read Tira's letter with rapt attention. The pages were filled with news of new friends, current interests, and the exciting expectations for the new semester that was about to begin. It was a very Tira-like letter, full of energy and enthusiasm, and it brought a smile to Odette's face.

But as she finished reading, her thoughts turned to a more pressing matter. Would Bastian agree to her request to visit her sister for a day?

Odette pondered for a few moments, her pen poised over the open notebook.

"Let's try to avoid bumping into each other," she wrote down.

When she made her way back from a weekend at the Demel's, she knew that a difficult decision lay ahead. With a heavy heart, she resolved to keep herself safe by avoiding any conflict with Bastian, no matter the cost.

For she had learned the hard way that it was when their paths crossed that the tension between them reached its breaking point. And though Bastian could be a man of few emotions, his wrath was a fearsome thing to behold, leaving Odette shaken and alone in its wake.

Yet even as she struggled to come to terms with the reality of her situation, she knew that they could continue on as polite strangers, bound together by the tenuous thread of their marriage.

They had to spend one more night in the Demels' villa, but nothing bad happened like it had the day before. Bastian, who had spent the entire night playing cards and hadn't entered the bedroom until just before morning, is to blame.

Odette gave her husband the bed and then left for the early morning walk she'd promised Marchioness Demel the day before. It was a respectful, natural outing. There was no difference between the two weekends they spent together in the Ardennes.

Odette welcomed her husband with a stunning display that belonged on the opera house stage.

Without a single idea or judgment in her head, she simply laughed while sitting motionless. Resentment occasionally crept in, the memory her being almost-raped flooded back but Odette handled it admirably. She would rather suffer disgrace than experience that once more. 

Only one letter remained in the stack of mail by the time the sunshine peaked through the window's open curtains and reached the desk's end. Maxime von Xanders, the charming botanist, the charming botanist had sent the letter.

Upon learning that Odette was creating a garden for their new mansion, Count Xanders took it upon himself to offer his expertise. With a kind and gentle demeanor, he recommended plants and flowers that would thrive in the unique climate of Ardennes, sharing his knowledge and experience with a generosity that was rare indeed.

And though his words were brief, they carried with them a warmth and sincerity that touched her deeply. For in his greeting, she sensed not only a deep gratitude for his kindness to her daughter, but also a genuine concern for her well-being.

As Odette stood up, her heart still warmed by the kindness of the letter, she was interrupted by the arrival of an unexpected message. New furniture had arrived, and she knew that she must make haste to oversee its placement.

Quickly smoothing down her hair and straightening the folds of her skirt, she made her way to the solarium, where the interior decorator awaited her arrival. Together, they worked tirelessly to ensure that each piece was perfectly placed, taking great care to bring out the full beauty and elegance of the room.

And as they finished their work, Odette's eyes were drawn to an unexpected surprise - a grand piano, sitting proudly in the center of the hexagonal room, its polished wood and gleaming keys.

As Odette gazed at the magnificent piano, her curiosity got the better of her. "Did my husband buy the piano?" she asked.

The interior decorator smiled proudly as he opened the lid of the piano, revealing its exquisite interior. "Actually, it was my idea to put a piano in the solarium," he said, a hint of self-satisfaction in his voice. "And your husband was more than happy to agree. But I must say, this is not just any piano. It took a lot of hard work and dedication to get a piece as rare and beautiful as this."

Although he was boasting, at least this claim was fairly accurate. Odette saw this at a glance for a person who had been playing the piano for many years.

Odette looked at the magnificent piano before her keenly, and wondered. For Bastian, a man who had never shown any interest in music, to have chosen such a luxurious instrument was a mystery that she could not unravel.

But even as she pondered the enigma before her, she knew that it was not hers to solve. And then she reminded herself of a simple truth: "Don't be greedy for what isn't mine." 

Odette scolded herself for her uncharacteristic greed, her eyes remained fixed on the beautiful piano before her. Even though she knew that she could never possess such a magnificent instrument, she couldn't cease longing and desiring to play it.



Bastian's departure from work was a welcome relief, coming earlier than he had anticipated. The preparations for the naval festival had been completed. But even as he savored this moment of respite, he couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation and weariness.

For he knew that his reprieve would be short-lived, and that he would soon have to return to the grindstone once again.

"I'll rest for a bit, Lovis" 

Bastian's command was brief and to the point. With that, he made his way to the study on the second floor.

The allotted break was less than thirty minutes, excluding the time he needed to get dressed and walk around.

Bastian sank into his plush wing chair, shedding his uniform jacket with a heavy sigh. Having taken several days off from work in order to complete his urgent business as quickly as possible, he knew that there was still much to be done. And so he worked late into the night, until the wee hours of the morning, before finally returning home to catch a few hours of rest.

But even as he closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift off, the insistent ring of the telephone shattered his peace. He could have ignored it, could have let Lovis take the call, but something inside him compelled him to answer.

And so he rose from his chair, crossed the room to his desk, and picked up the receiver with a sense of weary resignation.

 “Yes. This is Bastian Klauswitz.”

Bastian held the receiver to his ear, the late afternoon sunlight casting a warm glow across his face. He waited patiently for a response, but none came.

As he was about to hang up, a voice on the other end spoke up, offering an awkward greeting. Bastian couldn't quite place the voice, but he knew it was someone he had spoken to before.

"It's me," the voice said hesitantly. "So..."

Bastian sighed, closing his eyes for a moment before looking out the window once more. 

"I know you, Odette" 

The strong coffee he had consumed earlier had left him feeling jittery and on edge, but now he felt the sharp edges of his nerves gradually dulling. It was a bittersweet sensation, not entirely unpleasant but also tinged with a sense of languid fatigue.


Chapter 45.
 The Perfect Aristocrat.




Odette serenely shared her experience of residing in the Ardene estate, revealing her plans to construct an outbuilding and purchase new furniture and paintings. Moreover, she mentioned the urgent need to respond to the pending invitations but Bastian only grasped the full extent of Odette's vision upon hearing her discuss the specific flora and fauna to be planted in the outbuilding's garden.

"I was contacted by the madam." Lovis frequently served as the bearer of news these days, with the madam communicating important matters to Odette via phone, and Lovis subsequently conveying them to him.

Bastian now understood why she had never given him a straight call. Because she always made sure to call during his absence in order to avoid having to speak with him. But her strategy failed since Bastian uncannily left for home early today.

[The piano arrived today] Odette announced.

Bastian, who was looking at his watch with a tired expression, responded after a short pause, "Piano?"

[Yes, the one for the solarium] Odette said, her voice filled with excitement as she went on to explain how wonderful the instrument was.

Bastian struggled to jog his memory, searching for any recollection of a piano delivery but to no avail.

The task of adorning the new home was solely entrusted to the empire's top interior decorator. His expertise in procuring opulent and costly items was sufficient for Bastian, who was content with simply signing checks for everything.

"Why?" Bastian asked with a hint of impatience. Just as the conversation was starting to frustrate him, Odette finally revealed her intention.

[Can I use the piano?]

"Why are you asking me that?" Bastian countered.

[Because it's yours] Odette replied, being cautious and prudent. [If you purchased it with someone else in mind, I won't play it.]

Bastian sighed in relief as he finally realized who the second person was that his wife had alluded to. He found it strangely amusing that Odette would pay attention to Sandrine. It wasn't an enjoyable feeling, though.

"I don't care about it, do whatever you want," Bastian said indifferently.

[Ah, okay]

"Is that a satisfactory answer?" Bastian asked.

[Yes, thank you, Bastian]. Odette replied, her tone shifting slightly to reveal a hint of excitement despite remaining professional. [I will treat it with care.]

[Uhm, Bastian] Odette’s voice lowering to a whisper. [I was thinking of going to Ratz tomorrow to get some sheet music] she added.

"And?" Bastian responded.

[Can I?]

"If I said no, would you reconsider going?" Bastian asked.

[Unfortunately, yes.]

"Why?" 

[Because I don't want to do anything that would upset you,]

Odette said without hesitation. Bastian's face softened into a helpless smile as he put the phone back in place. His gaze shifted from his watch to the garden outside the window, where golden sunlight was streaming in. The breeze carried a sweet fragrance.

The fragrance of golden oaks signaled the farewell of summer.

From that day forward, Odette went to great lengths to feign ignorance.

Bastian couldn't fathom her motives, but her ruse wasn't very convincing. Nevertheless, he humored her moderately, as he had no inclination to delve into the matter at present.

As his father scrambled to reorganize his troops in response to the sudden declaration of war, Bastian too rallied to confront the enemy.

The major strategies had been put in place, yet careful coordination was required to counter the adversary's moves. Deception was the key to success in this game of chess.

Bastian anticipated a leisurely pace, with ample time to plot his next move. However, an unforeseen twist threw his plans into disarray.

Admiral Demel hinted that the emperor was wary of him and his spouse.

The proximity between Ratz and Ardene was not great, and the emperor found it peculiar for a newlywed couple to be separated. He suggested to quash any gossip before it spread, but it was merely an imperial decree conveyed through Admiral Demel's mouth.

Bastian appeared to be under pressure to complete the firm work as soon as possible in order to soothe the uneasy emperor.

"I want to see you tomorrow at 12, come to the Admiralty," Bastian said in a composed tone.

[Do you mean we're meeting?]

"I don't like being away for too long, so maybe we can have lunch together.”

[You don't have to do that, I'll just get the sheet music and return.]

"I'll inform the entrance checkpoint, just mention my name," 

Bastian stated the situation unambiguously, leaving no room for debate. Admiral Demel acted as the emperor's eyes and ears, so it wouldn't hurt to demonstrate his unwavering loyalty by following his commands. It was like wagging his tail, proving his allegiance.

[Alright, then.] Odette said, despite her apparent reluctance. [By the way, Bastian, can I ask you something?].

"Go ahead," 

[Well, getting into the Admiralty might be a bit awkward and unfamiliar for me. Would it be possible to change the meeting place? What do you think?]

"How about we meet at the fountain in front of the Admiralty's main entrance instead?" Bastian suggested. After some back-and-forth, Odette quietly agreed. "Tomorrow at 12, at the fountain in front of the Admiralty."

After affirming the appointment, Bastian hung up the phone. As he spun around, massaging his tired eyes and temples, the chime of the bell echoed, marking the end of the brief interval.



Theodora Klauswitz let out a nervous cry as she drew the curtains, obscuring the once-glorious seascape that was a source of pride for the mansion. 

"This is truly horrible," she exclaimed. "How much longer do we have to endure living like this?"

Franz took a break from his book and let out a heavy sigh, lifting his gaze. His mother, a bundle of nerves, was pacing the room, cigarette in hand. Her once poised and elegant demeanor was now marred by a growing dependence on alcohol and nicotine, a result of the torment she's been enduring since Bastian's mansion across the bay was revealed. She no longer carried the grace she once did.

"Have faith in Father, Mother," Franz said, trying to mask his own doubts. "He's determined to find a solution, so I'm sure he'll figure it out soon."

"You always act like this tragedy doesn't concern you," Theodora chided.

"I'm just trying to keep my worries in check. I'm just as concerned as you are."

"Then don't waste your time with those books! Help your father instead. This isn't the time for carelessness!"

The blame shifted. Franz, feeling disillusioned, put up with his mother's persistent scolding.

"Do you think Bastian might be considering marrying the Duke of Felia's daughter after using the daughter of the beggar duke to build connections?" his mother ranted before spiraling into her own fantastical musings.

"No matter how crazy he is, he wouldn't do something so heinous to the emperor's niece, Odette," Franz tried to reassure her.

"Odette, the emperor's niece, may be well-spoken, but she's a weakling with no influence. There's no reason for Bastian to not dispose of her. After all, he's the son of Jeff Klauswitz!" Theodora sneered, picking up her cup with the hand that had just put down her cigarette. "I should have put a stop to this before it got this far, instead of caring about appearances. Your father was foolish to think he could raise a monster like Bastian and then just get rid of him. It's a disaster."

Theodora gulped down the stabilizer along with the poisonous alcohol and slumped back onto the sofa as if defeated.

"By the way, Franz," she started, "it's strange. Everyone thinks Bastian and Odette are madly in love, but the servants say otherwise."

"What are you referring to, Mother?" 

"Bastian may visit Ardennes every weekend, but he always stays in a different room," Theodora revealed. "A virile young man like him wouldn't do that if he was truly in love with his wife. And since the Duke of Pelia's daughter can't walk, there's no way she has any physical issues."

Franz rose from his seat, his expression stern. The wind blew a book off its place, sending it tumbling across the vibrant patterned carpet, but Theodora paid it no mind, reaching for her cigarette once more.

"Mother! Did you really conduct such a dirty background check?"

"Yes, my dear," Theodora said, her gaze softening as she looked at her son. "May you flourish as a noble flower of our family. I will bear the dirt and grime for you. I devoted my entire life to protecting your father, and I want to make sure that the legacy of that love is safeguarded. You need to understand that. And please, don't disappoint your father. I beg of you."

"No matter what I do, Father is always ready to be disappointed," Franz replied with a sigh.

"The more he continues like this, the harder you'll have to work! Why don't you visit Ella? Your father would be over the moon if you formed an in-law relationship with Count Klein. Make sure to cling to your fiancée. Focus on your job and continue learning."

"Father devoted his entire life to becoming a noble, but as the heir to a noble family, he's eager to turn me into a merchant.”

"Franz," Theodora said, approaching her son and sighing deeply. "The world is changing. A nobleman who doesn't have a source of wealth can no longer call himself a nobleman. Just look at Bastian's wife. Despite her noble blood, they live in poverty. But you're different. With your father's estate and my distinguished lineage, you have inherited the perfect combination to be the ideal aristocrat of the new era."

"But I..." Franz started to object.

Theodora's hand were holding tight to Franz's shoulder, was brimming with intensity as she said, "You can do it. I know you can. Right? Isn't that right?"

".....Yes, Mother." Franz could only offer the one acceptable response, and Theodora beamed with satisfaction before drifting off to sleep.

Franz summoned the servants to escort his mother to her bedchamber. As the commotion died down, the sun started its descent. Back in his room, Franz stepped out onto the balcony overlooking the bay and released a deep sigh. 

In the distance, the silhouette of the mansion across the sea, tinged with the hue of a setting sun, was just barely visible. It was exactly where Odette resided.

Franz approached the railing and delicately clasped the small piece of gold foil he had hidden in the depths of his vest pocket. During their fateful encounter at the gallery, they shared tea together, and the eager-to-please gallery owner had presented a spread of cookies and cakes, but Odette only indulged in a single piece of chocolate. In a moment of impulsiveness, Franz had taken its wrapper, feeling both shame and a lack of remorse.

What was he doing now?

Franz thought of Odette, feeling the gold foil against his fingertips, yearning to gaze upon her face of perfect beauty. He longed to open his heart to her, to love her.

By the time his heated breath had subsided, a heavy dusk had descended.

After departing from the balcony, Franz retrieved the notebook he had concealed on his desk. It was a collection of art, solely dedicated to portraits of Odette. As he reached the final page, Franz began to sketch Odette once more, the sound of his pencil gliding across the paper filling the room as the darkness deepened.


Chapter 46.
A Long Wait.


At the onset of Preve Avenue, stood the Navy department, an imposing structure at the heart of the city, flanked by the magnificent Prater River and the impressive edifices of the cathedral and government offices. Odette gazed up at the grandiose building, marveling at the golden spire that stretched towards the heavens, crowned with a trident emblem, a symbol of the awe-inspiring might of the sea god.

Although she had traversed this locale countless times before, it was only today that her eyes were truly opened to its wonders. With measured breaths, she made her way towards the marble fountain that graced the front of the Admiralty's main entrance. Towering above the fountain's surface were statues of mighty sea gods, their forms a fusion of human and fish, from whose imposing bodies surged powerful jets of water.

The fountain's periphery, doubling as a seat, was bustling with individuals biding their time or seeking respite. Amidst the throng of people, Odette found a spot sandwiched between an elderly gentleman engrossed in his paper and a gaggle of schoolgirls in matching uniforms. Positioned to face the Admiralty's entrance, she straightened her attire and cast a glance at her wristwatch, noting that she still had half an hour until the scheduled meeting.

Uncertain of whether there was ample time to undertake any other pursuit, she opted to prolong her wait in the present spot. Retrieving a paperback book from her bag, Odette opened its pages, though her thoughts were too muddled to truly engage with the text. Nonetheless, she sought to avoid appearing fidgety and impatient in front of the man she was meeting. The minutes ticked by, with twenty having elapsed already.

Odette intermittently riffled through the pages, deliberating on which musical scores to procure. As she perused the options, a niggling sense of doubt crept into her mind, causing her to question whether her abilities had deteriorated significantly. Consequently, she resolved to focus on honing her skills through practice pieces in the interim. The minutes ticked away, with fifteen having elapsed thus far.

Emerging from beyond the raised drawbridge, a mighty warship sailed into view, drawing the attention of onlookers who hurried towards the river's edge. As the crowds dispersed, a hush fell over the once-bustling fountain. Casting a quizzical gaze around her surroundings, Odette soon refocused her attention on the paperback in her hands. It was then that an unwelcome voice rang out, shattering the peace.

“Hello, Odette.” 

At the sound of a saccharine and affable voice of Sandrine, Odette lifted her head to meet the anticipated countenance. Concluding her perusal of the book, Odette shut it and rose to her feet.

 "Greetings, Countess Lenart. It has been some time," she replied evenly and courteously, meeting Sandrine's scrutinizing stare with composure.

"It appears that you are awaiting someone at the Admiralty," Sandrine observed, her gaze following the direction of Odette's stare.

"Yes, I have a lunch appointment," 

"Ah, how fortuitous. I, too, am destined for the Admiralty to meet someone. Shall we proceed together?" Sandrine proposed

"No, I shall wait here. This is the designated location for the appointment. Farewell, Countess Lenart," Odette declined with a firm yet polite tone. Following her rejection, she returned to her seat by the fountain.

"It is disheartening to discover that a lady with imperial lineage from the Berg family, renowned for their impeccable conduct, could exhibit such impolite behavior." Sandrine sneered.

Odette faced Sandrine squarely, her hands clasped calmly on her lap, showing no trace of embarrassment, “"When has it ever been acceptable for an officer's spouse to show discourtesy to a Countess of Berg?" 

"If you are the wife of Captain Klauswitz and I am Countess Lenart, then certainly, such behavior would constitute a significant affront. However, I daresay our relationship is somewhat different," Sandrine retorted.

"Based on your words and actions thus far, it would appear that you do not acknowledge me as Bastian Klauswitz's wife. Rather, you seem to believe that this position is rightfully yours. However, it is not possible for a man to have two wives concurrently, and thus, I have elected to withdraw and grant it to you when the appropriate time arrives." Odette inclined her head slightly as she spoke, with an unyielding gaze fixed on Sandrine.

"What are you trying to say?"

"I shall revert to my customary decorum and conduct only after relinquishing my position as Mrs. Klauswitz. As you mentioned, I am a noblewoman with royal blood from a ducal family. Therefore, why should I submit to your authority?" replied Odette, her tone unwavering despite the flagrant sophistry she employed. "Kindly elucidate your intentions. If you desire me to fulfill the role of an officer's wife, I shall endeavor to do so. I apologize for my previous discourteous behavior towards a lady of elevated status. However, if your intention is to feign being Mrs. Klauswitz in my presence, be prepared for my continued conduct," Odette declared calmly, maintaining her composure as Sandrine appeared taken aback by her words. 

"What if I were to rise and offer an apology?"  

Odette raised her head, her opulent diamond earrings glinting as she spoke. Meanwhile, Sandrine gazed at Odette's audacious countenance, a peculiar smile playing on her lips, even as she noted the brazen act of taking something that belonged to another.

"It is a rather touching reflection indeed. I suggest that you relax and relish your reading," 

"Indeed, thank you for comprehending," Odette nodded her head before opening her diminutive book that rested on the fountain's edge. Her countenance seemed to dismiss Sandrine's presence altogether, despite the latter still being in close proximity.

Silently, Sandrine turned away, electing not to utter another word. The air was suffused with her icy rage and contempt, yet she derived solace from the knowledge that Bastian Klauswitz had not been ensnared by a pretty, vapid imbecile. While such a development could potentially complicate matters, it was preferable to allowing the man to remain unimportant.

"Seriously, Odette," 

Sandrine’s voice rang out as she abruptly halted at the threshold of the path that led to the Admiralty's main gate. Odette, seated with a straight back and engrossed in her book, gradually lifted her gaze to meet Sandrine's piercing stare.

"I trust that you have ample reading material at your disposal. The wait may be prolonged, far beyond your expectations," Sandrined advised, offering what appeared to be her final act of kindness.

Odette bowed respectfully without uttering a word. She lowered her gaze to resume her perusal of the open book. The sun's laggard rays of late summer bathed the woman in a tranquil glow as she immersed herself in the world of her reading material. The vista that stretched out before her was a breathtaking panorama that seemed to implore the suspension of time.



"Sandrine, I'm sorry but Bastian is currently dealing with an emergency," said Lucas firmly. He was aware of Sandrine's intentions when she had called him out of the blue to ask for lunch. Apparently, she had only used the invitation as a ploy to see Bastian.

Sandrine's lifeless eyes suddenly betrayed a flicker of emotion. "Did something bad happen?" 

Lucas saw the fear in her cousin's eyes. For a moment, he felt defeated and let out a resigned sigh.

Despite the annoyance of being used by Sandrine time and time again, Lucas found it difficult to hold a grudge against her. He understood his sister's heart all too well. Her love for Bastian was genuine and Lucas knew this better than anyone.  Sandrine had been this way ever since she met Bastian for the first time.

Lucas always wondered how Sandrine could give her whole heart to a man who was incapable of loving anyone else. Her love for Bastian was unrequited and misguided, and he had tried to talk her out of it for a while. But at some point, Lucas realized that Sandrine didn't actually want her love to be reciprocated. She seemed content with just possessing Bastian, even if he was only using her in return. It was a very sad situation, with a woman desperate for love and a man who seemed incapable of returning it.

The relationship they had was one where neither of them lost; in fact, they were a perfect match for each other.

"He just got a call from the imperial palace. Apparently, there's an urgent matter to discuss regarding the Belov delegation's attendance at the naval festival. Admiral Demel needs to meet with His Majesty in person, and he'll be meeting with Bastian," 

"But what about the lunch with Bastian?" asked Sandrine.

Lucas let out a frustrated sigh, seeming tired of all the drama. "In this situation, there's no time for lunch. They need to rush to the imperial palace right away," he explained, frowning. "So, let's not waste our time thinking about anything else today. Just you and I can have lunch together in peace."

Lucas donned the officer's cap he had been holding and gestured for Sandrine to follow as they made their way out of the headquarters building's lobby. Lucas knew she would have to leave again soon yet, Sandrine had insisted on coming here to see Bastian. He Felt a twinge of pity for her as her desperate attempts to catch a glimpse of him had left her in tears.

Lucas spun around in a panic upon realizing that he couldn't hear Sandrine's footsteps. "What are you doing?" he asked, puzzled.

Sandrine had been lost in thought and staring off into space. "Did Bastian already go to the imperial palace?" she asked, her eyes suddenly lighting up with hope.

"He hasn't left yet, but he'll probably be on his way soon. Look, there's a black car parked under the stairs of the headquarters building," Lucas replied casually, pointing in its direction.

Sandrine looked disappointed. "I'm sorry, Lucas. Let's have lunch another time. I'll treat you to a nice meal to make it up to you," 

"What's going on? What are you planning to do?"

"It's nothing for you to worry about," Sandrine replied, flashing him a knowing smile. With that, she began to make her way toward the central staircase leading to the lobby



Sandrine stood there, on the stairs,  not looking at Bastian even once.  Admiral Demel suddenly appeared on the stairs.

"Who is this! Isn't that Countess Lenart!"

"Hello, Admiral," Sandrine greeted the Admiral with a weak, trembling voice. 

Admiral Demel looked at her with concern, as expected. "Why are you here?" 

"I was supposed to have lunch with Captain Ewald but I was about to leave because I suddenly got a headache. I guess with so many things to worry about, this happens often and causes trouble for those around me." Sandrine let out a quiet sigh, her face expressing sadness.

Admiral Demel was a man of honor, a true gentleman, the polar opposite of Bastian. He couldn't bear to turn away a lady in distress. 

"Well then, let's ride together," he offered without hesitation. "Time is running out, so it might be difficult to take you all the way home. However, since the Lenart family's residence is on the way to the imperial palace, it's not an inconvenience to drop you off there."

Sandrine was grateful for the offer, and at times like this, she was glad for the rumors that surrounded her. Her reputation as a woman abandoned by her husband for another man had proven to be useful.

"Lord Demel, you are very kind. Thank you. I feel a bit shameful, but I appreciate your help," Sandrine replied gratefully, seizing the opportunity without hesitation. She glanced up at Bastian to see any expression yet he displayed none.

Perhaps he had already opened up to his wife about his situation, but it made no difference to Sandrine. Her sole intention was to plant a tiny seed of uncertainty in Odette's mind. And for the time being, that was sufficient. Let Odette take care of nurturing and cultivating that seed.

Sandrine strolled past the flabbergasted Lucas and was escorted out of the headquarters lobby by Admiral Demel. Once they descended the steps, the chauffeur sprang into action, opening the door of the waiting vehicle for them.

With Admiral Demel and Sandrine securely seated in the back, Bastian settled into the front passenger seat. The ceremonial car then smoothly pulled away from the Admiralty, piloted by its uniformed driver.

As Sandrine drove down the long, tree-lined driveway, the main gate with its checkpoint loomed into view. She cast a scrutinizing gaze at the fountain beyond the fence, and despite the considerable distance, she easily spotted the woman who was still on guard duty.

The fluttering hem of a sunny yellow chiffon dress caught her eye, swaying in the breeze. There was no mistaking it that was Odette indeed.

Chapter 47.
 May It Pass by Like This.




Odette was engrossed in a book as she lounged by the fountain, appearing serene and unaware of the recent cancellation of her appointment.

Bastian let out a sigh as the barrier lifted, and the car crept closer to the fountain, passing by the officers standing at attention. The road in front of the Naval department forked into three paths that encircled the fountain, and to reach the western road that led to the Imperial Palace, they had to navigate around it.

He  wished the vehicle would just keep moving.

Bastian scribbled a note and entrusted it to the soldier on duty, instructing them to rush it over to Odette. He wanted to ensure it reached her promptly, so she could attend to her own affairs.

Perhaps, he thought, it would be a welcome change for the woman.

He sighed and tore his gaze away from the car window, just as Odette set down her book.

Glancing at her watch, Odette gazed at the main gate of the Admiralty with a composed expression. 20 minutes had already passed since the designated time, and she simply waited in silence, biding her time.

Bastian was jolted by a memory of their first official meeting, when she had stoically awaited his arrival despite his intentional lateness. She was his arranged spouse, after all.

As the realization that he had, in fact, married the woman washed over him once more, Odette's gaze shifted to the car.

But it was a fleeting moment.

In no time, the car picked up speed and the distance between it and Odette grew rapidly.

Yet, the instant their gazes locked stayed imprinted in Bastian's mind like a brightly lit snapshot.

Odette quickly rose from the fountain upon recognizing him, her blank eyes fixated on him. She briefly glanced at the backseat before locking eyes with him once more.

Her expression appeared pained, though it was difficult to tell for certain. The car had already turned onto the western road when Bastian pondered this.

As he unconsciously relaxed his fists, the car steadily picked up speed.

Odette, now a small yellow speck, receded from view as she stood alone by the fountain.

The emperor's directive and his pledge to Odette echoed in his mind.

It wasn't a decision that required weighing the pros and cons, and he made the necessary choice. He was aware that he could have paused the car for a moment in front of the fountain to explain the situation, but he didn't.

His wife of two years simply could not be his top priority.

It was only natural. She was a woman who possessed nothing and had nothing to offer. What could she possibly bring to the table for him?

Bastian lifted his gaze from his closed eyes to the front mirror with a deep sigh. When their eyes met in the reflection, Sandrine’s lips curved into a gentle smile.

"How's your headache holding up?" Admiral Demel cautiously interrupted the quiet of the car.

"It's still persistent, but thanks to you, it's improved greatly," Sandrine replied, her expression brightening briefly before she let out a weary sigh. She looked like a person on the brink of exhaustion. "Thank you so much. If it weren't for your help, Admiral, I'm sure I would have been suffering for days."

"It's my duty," Admiral Demel replied, his eyes filled with genuine concern and the soldier's honor of being chivalrous. He cast a glance at Sandrine. Meanwhile, Bastian, uninterested in the conversation, turned his attention to the Prater River that flowed past the passenger window.

As the scorching sun began to set, the world around them became clearer, with sharp outlines emerging. The verdant hues of the roadside trees had dulled, and the water had taken on a deeper hue.

An image of Odette, watching the car fade into the distance over a summer landscape past its prime, suddenly flashed through his mind like a light bulb.

As the seasons changed and the festivities came to a close, Bastian would be granted permission to head to the front lines.

This simple reality banished the annoyance caused by the lingering image of the ineffectual woman. He would soon be departing and, once the agreed-upon period had passed, he would return and address this marriage. In the meantime, she would prove useful by efficiently fulfilling her duties and fading away without any further hassle.

With the irrelevant memory banished, Bastian fixed his gaze on the road ahead. He didn't cast a single glance behind him until he had left the Lenart family behind and arrived at the regal gates of the Imperial Palace.



The rustling of leaves in the breeze created a melodic counterpoint to the tranquil gurgle of the fountain.

With slow, deliberate movements, Odette tore open the envelope amidst the invigorating commotion. Her skirt, adorned with layers of chiffon, was in disarray, much like her current emotional state.

The brief note from Bastian read: "I have a pressing issue to attend to, so I must reschedule our meal for another time." Just one line of inconsiderate notice.

She read the note over and over again before neatly folding it and tucking it away in her handbag.

The river breeze died down, and the shadows cast by the swaying tree branches above her head grew still. The young soldier, who was on errand duty, continued to stand guard and kept a close eye on her expression.

"Thank you," Odette said with a soft smile, "You may go now." The soldier, his cheeks flushing, quickly lowered his head in a bow before spinning on his heel and rushing away.

As the soldier's figure vanished behind the barriers of the Admiralty, Odette released the quiet sigh that had been pent up within her.

She fully comprehended Bastian's circumstances.

The sight of him departing with Admiral Demel in a military vehicle made it evident that he was conducting official business. The presence of Sandrine was irksome, but Odette knew it was not a matter she could intervene in.

Sandrine held a greater significance in his heart than his wife ever could, a fact he had made evident from the very moment he broached the topic of marriage. But to say he "proposed" would suggest an ongoing connection between them after their weddings - a connection he had no intention of fostering.

Odette tore her gaze away from the road's vanishing point and made a decision. She would purge the memory of Bastian from her mind, for he had callously ignored his waiting wife and was now consumed by regret.

Though Odette was aware of everything, she still chose to go through with the marriage. She refused to second-guess herself now or to lay blame on Bastian. After all, it was a sham of a union, a mere transaction that would benefit them both.

With her mind made up, Odette departed from the fountain dissolving regrets within her heart. It didn't take her long to traverse from the Admiralty to the bustling heart of downtown.

Odette thought the entire time she was alone, strolling down the street that it was actually lovely not to have to be with the bothersome man. The same held true as she leisurely strolled the mall, selected some sheet music, and went to the outdoor cafe. 

"Is there anyone accompanying you?" the manager asked, repeating the same question as before.

"No, I'm alone," replied Odette, her response unchanged from the previous occasion.

With kindness, the manager led her to a charming terrace that offered a picturesque view. As she settled at the table, memories flooded back - this was the very spot where she had shared an unexpected tea with Bastian.

The manager, having set aside the menu, looked concernedly at Odette's expression, "Is everything okay? Are you experiencing any inconvenience?"

Odette smiled and shook her head, "No, I'm alright." Although it was an unpleasant coincidence, she didn't feel the need to switch seats over it.

After indulging in a coffee and cake treat, Odette took a moment to bask in the breathtaking scenery along the Prater River. The tranquil waters glimmered with the dazzling afternoon sun, painting a serene picture. Just then, a tap on her table brought her thoughts to a man who embodied the same radiant glow.

Odette, who realized it couldn't be Bastian, glanced up in shock. Even more profound and icy disillusionment overcame her when she noticed a strange man standing there.

"Greetings! It appears you're lone.” A man donned in a vintage infantry officer's uniform flashed a warm, sugary smile. “Would the lovely lady permit me the privilege of treating her to a cup of tea to fight her loneliness?"

With a gaze that betrayed his true motive, he cast a look at the unoccupied seat across from Odette. He was a typical city rogue who relished in the thrill of wooing single women in his leisure. This type was all too familiar to Odette, having encountered it multiple times in the past.

"My spouse will be arriving shortly," Odette replied firmly yet gently, emphasizing her point by placing her glittering wedding ring on the table.

"I apologize," the man said, his face flushing with embarrassment, before scurrying off. Odette let out a soft sigh as she gazed at her husband's vacant seat. She was grateful to have escaped the situation, but at the same time, her heart ached with sadness.

In a moment like this, the only person she could rely on was her faux spouse. The irony of it all was both poignant and comical.

Has that pressing matter been taken care of by now?

Odette pondered aimlessly, absentmindedly flipping through the sheet music she had acquired earlier.

No doubt he's with Countess Lenart, her heart whispered.

As she reached a casual conclusion, a waiter carrying a tray approached her table.

Gathering the sheet music that failed to capture her attention, Odette sat up straight and gazed at her wedding band.

The table fell into silence once more as the waiter finished his duties and disappeared.

After taking a moment to catch her breath and carefully centering a vase containing a single rose on the table, Odette indulged in her own private tea time. The Prater River, with its glistening waves of gold, provided a stunning backdrop as she savored every sip of her coffee and every bite of her delectable cake.

Despite the peacefulness of the moment, Odette's attention was solely focused on tidying up the teacups and plates, almost as if it were a task she had been assigned. In her fervor, she forgot all about the empty chair opposite her, once reserved for her husband who would never again join her for tea.

Deciding not to dwell on what couldn't be hers, she found solace in the idea that having no regrets was the best outcome. As she had learned from the countless losses she endured in her past, the pain of parting ways would be commensurate with the magnitude of the love she had given.

And so, armed with this knowledge, she settled into a leisurely tea time.

With her long-awaited dream finally realized, Odette said goodbye to the al fresco café as the sun began its descent. Upon reaching City Hall, her agreed-upon rendezvous with her chauffeur, the entire metropolis had taken on a warm, rosy hue.

"Has Master Bastian already departed?" Hans queried, his brow furrowed as he emerged from the sunny yellow convertible.

"Oh yes, he's got a tight schedule," Odette replied smoothly, concealing the truth.

"I see. And was everything to your satisfaction, ma'am?" 

Odette answered with a beaming grin, as if her smile was a suit of armor to protect herself. Mrs. Klauswitz's joyful excursion came to a close with the clock tower ringing out the hour.

With Ratz receding in the distance, Odette's vehicle raced down the road. It was a sultry late summer evening, and the shadows of objects were stretched out into the purple night.

Chapter 48.
Wednesday When Her Husband Come Home.



Thomas Muller let out a heavy sigh as he approached the young master. "It's time for you to take a well-deserved break, my friend. You've been holed up here all weekend, so go home and get some proper rest."

Bastian strode into his office with a smile on his face, his uniform from the Admiralty still fresh from a day's work. Despite the grueling workload he's faced since Monday, he radiated an uncharacteristic energy, his brisk pace belying any fatigue.

Bastian placed his hat on the desk and pivoted to face Thomas. "It seems like it's the director who could use a break." 

"Are you trying to be humorous?" Thomas replied, arching an eyebrow.

"You didn't tell my grandfather that," Bastian countered.

"Because he was a far better man than his grandson," Thomas shot back. The complaint that was previously on his lips dissolved into a fit of helpless laughter.

Carl Illis was by no means an easy boss—he had a fiery temperament and bulllike stubbornness—but at least he was more compassionate than his grandson. He wasn't alone in thinking that; everyone who worked for this family did.

"That is the ultimate praise," Bastian said as he slowly lifted his closed lids and rang the call bell. A secretary soon entered, carrying a steaming cup of robust coffee.

Thomas watched Bastian savor his coffee, his gaze growing introspective. "It's all winding down now. No need to hurry," 

Fake mines. Bonds and stock are reduced to paper crumbs. Ghost businesses dressed as golden-egg-laying geese.

Nearing completion was the Jeff Klauswitz capture trap. Finding a good location and setting the bait were the only remaining tasks.

"Let's strive to complete it as swiftly as we can." Bastian replied resolutely, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. At first glance, his face appeared to be that of a stern priest, perhaps due to the color of his uniform that bore a striking resemblance to religious attire.

"It's not as if it's going to end anytime soon. It will take time to fully engage them. It's all about being patient..."

"I understand," Bastian interjected with a polite smile. "It doesn't matter how many years it takes. It's not difficult to wait for a predetermined conclusion. But I don't think we need to be bogged down with this task for too long. Don't you agree?"

"Is there anything in particular that leads you to believe that?" Thomas asked.

Bastian placed his half-empty cup down calmly, "I'm planning to relocate to Ardennes this week, so I need to wrap up all my pressing matters before then." 

As they spoke, the sunset reached its peak and painted the office a brilliant shade of red.

He made every effort to put off the joining until the day of his departure for the frontier, but it was becoming increasingly impossible to keep to that schedule because of Crown Prince Belov's unanticipated factor.

On the day he was unexpectedly summoned to the imperial palace, the emperor himself broke the news. ‘Crown Prince Belov, who is heading a delegation on a state visit to Berg, has expressed his desire to attend the simultaneous naval festival’ 

The Prince offered a credible excuse of checking in on allies, but the true intention was unmistakable. It was evident that they sought to verify the legitimacy of the scandal that had made headlines beyond their borders. This meant that Bastian and Odette had to put on a flawless display as a couple. It was, of course, what the emperor desired as well.

Thomas Muller, lost in thought, posed a question. "It's not ideal for newlyweds to be separated like this, but this arrangement is somewhat unconventional. Perhaps it would be better for Mrs. Klauswitz to temporarily reside in Ratz?"

"If the listing issue gets resolved, I won't have much difficulty staying in Ardennes and handling the business," Bastian stated nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. "I have no qualms entrusting my wife with a task that falls within my jurisdiction."

Obviously, Thomas had a point. He didn't have to be in such a rush because there was still plenty of time before Crown Prince Belov's arrival. Bastian was fully aware that after stabilizing the business, it would be sufficient to move through with the merger.

It was a necessary step in the end. Bastian gazed down at the phone on the desk. He had lingered in front of it for an extended period the day he impulsively made a decision. It was during the sunset hour, much like now, on the evening he returned from the imperial palace. Yet, Bastian simply stared at the phone, not daring to pick it up.

Bastian didn't have to explain anything to Odette or ask her for her understanding. The phone's late-night quiet made this clear and confirmed that she felt the same way.

Bastian steeled his emotions as soon as he realized their connection was only a business arrangement. There was no reason why they couldn't live together if it was only a business relationship. This would increase the emperor's confidence and increase the value of the deal.

That was a choice that would be beneficial to Odette as well.

"I thought you were opposed to this marriage," Despite the lighthearted laughter, Thomas’s gaze was piercing as he gazed at Bastian. "Turns out you're a much better husband than I anticipated."

Bastian nonchalantly unbuttoned his uniform as he quipped, "You have a noble bride, so why shouldn't you?" The interplay of light and shadow accentuated the sharp contours of his face, adding an air of mystery to his appearance.

"But your wife is a stunning woman," Thomas said, before retracting his statement.

Leaving on his device, Bastian removed his shirt and jacket one by one and walked up to the washbasin. His consciousness was much clearer after he washed his face with cold water. While it was insufficient for him to completely overcome his accumulated exhaustion, it was plenty for the remainder of the work being done.

He changed into fresh attire and tidied his disheveled hair. He meticulously arranged the uniform he had removed, a habit ingrained from his extensive military service. With his tie in place, he retrieved his jacket from the back of his chair and made his way out of the office.

As he entered the elongated hallway leading to the conference room, the memory of the woman who had been endlessly awaiting his return surfaced in his mind.

Odette remained in the fading summer sunlight, and he could easily picture her from that day.

The expression on her face that resembled that of an abandoned kid when she first spotted him in the moving car and the vacant stare in her eyes

The carefree passage of the urban landscape and the hemline of her yellow dress fluttered in the wind.

The reason why the incident was so vividly etched was presumably due to its exceptionality. It was surprising that a woman who normally exuded calm and style would display such intensity. Maybe it was an illusion brought on by a misrepresented memory.

With a shake of his head, Bastian strode confidently down the sun-drenched corridor. There was no use in speculating. It was more prudent to complete the task at hand and lay his eyes on the woman himself.

With only three days left, Bastian estimated the amount of time left and again fussed over his tie knot. His plan abruptly changed as he walked up to the conference room door where the board members were waiting with eagerness.

Possibly two days. That appeared to be plenty.



Odette was rehearsing a challenging tune on the piano in the solarium when she heard that Bastian had arrived. It was a tired afternoon, and she was having trouble understanding the difficult composition.

"What day is it today?" Odette asked, attempting to mask her bewilderment.

"It's Wednesday, ma'am," the maid replied, looking quite puzzled.

Odette nodded, confirming that her recollection was accurate, but this only deepened her confusion.

She didn't understand how a man who hadn't even arrived on the promised weekend had shown up here on a Wednesday. Was it the sun, which was incredibly clear and bright? She felt like she was dreaming oddly.

"If I may be so bold, shouldn't you go see the master as soon as possible?" Dora offered her cautious advice, clearing her throat.

Only then did Odette snap out of her daze and hastily rise from the piano. Upon entering the grand foyer of the mansion, she realized that she was not appropriately dressed.

She stopped in the middle of adjusting her hair, which had been braided like a child's when Lovis walked up to her. She was startled by the sound of an unknown voice, and it took her a second to identify the elderly guy who was bowing profoundly in her presence.

"Hello, Lovis. It's been a while," Odette greeted him.

Fortunately, Odette recalled that Lovis served as the household's butler. He had made a brief stopover during the wedding week before going back to Ratz to help Bastian, as she remembered. Behind him were the other servants, who bowed in unison.

Everyone who was still working at the Ratz townhouse had relocated there.

Odette made an effort to comprehend what that reality meant. No. She was actually aware of the answer. She was simply not prepared to accept it.

The elderly butler observed as Odette glanced around the hallway, "The master has already gone up to the bedroom."

Odette's eyes widened in shock as she looked up at the magnificent central staircase in the hallway. Bastian had changed from the kind guest he had been pretending to be. He appeared to be claiming his ownership of the gorgeous mansion as the rightful owner.

With each step up the staircase, Odette struggled to keep her nerves from unraveling, determined to maintain a sense of composure. However, her heart refused to cooperate, beating erratically as she approached the third floor where the couple's bedroom was situated. It was as if her anxiety was betraying her, threatening to expose her unease at any moment.

"No, ma'am, not that room."

She heard another strange voice as she unlocked Bastian's bedroom door. Young attendant who was most likely from Ratz.

"The master is there," was said. The attendant made a courteous gesture, pointing to Odette's bedroom.

Why on earth?

Odette unlocked her room's door with a shaky hand as she was overcome by a nagging dread.

Bastian stood before the window, gazing out at the sea as waves of white light danced around him, creating an ethereal aura. 

Odette steeled herself and crossed the threshold into the bedroom, taking a deep breath. As the door clicked shut, Bastian slowly turned to face her. Despite the gravity of the situation, his demeanor was oddly composed, his head slightly bowed and hands clasped behind his back. But there was also an air of arrogance about him, a quality that seemed out of character for the person who had committed such a heinous act.

Like a tempest suppressed within her, Odette initially responded to Bastian's presence with a courteous facade. However, as she lifted her head to meet his gaze, the full weight of reality came crashing down upon her, threatening to overwhelm her. It was as though the turbulent emotions she had been holding back had been unleashed all at once.

Her mind wandered back to the Wednesday her husband had arrived, the sea sparkling in the distance under a clear, mild sky that bridged the gap between summer and fall.


Chapter 49.
The Changing Seasons.



The lethargy that had been nagging at Bastian all day seemed to intensify as he got out of the shower. He was too exhausted to care over his messy, damp hair as he ran his fingers through it while wearing a bathrobe that was only lightly buttoned. He couldn't remember the last time he had gotten a good night's sleep.

Bastian had been pushing himself relentlessly to complete his work well ahead of schedule. Day after day, he soldiered on, taking brief naps whenever overwhelming drowsiness threatened to overtake him, consuming perfunctory meals, and then diving straight back into work.

With his eyes half-shut and his steps faltering, he shuffled towards his wife's bedroom door. Though it was only nine o'clock, he longed for rest today. Collapsing onto the bed with a bone-weary sigh. He appeared to be capable of sleeping for several days in a row in a deathly sleep.

Bastian moved towards the corridor that connected the two rooms with a firm step. All that was left to do was wait for his father to take the bait after he had carefully constructed a lure. Final touches were being made to the preparations for the impending naval event.

With just one mission left to accomplish, Bastian knew that he had to execute the perfect portrayal of newlyweds in love. This was precisely why he had agreed to Admiral Demel's offer of a honeymoon vacation, despite the web of lies that would inevitably ensnare him. Deceiving the ever-suspicious Crown Prince of Belov would require a complex and intricate fabrication, but it was the only way to capitalize on the freedom he had worked so hard to secure.

He finally reached the end of the dimly lighted hallway and gently knocked on Odette's door. His wet hair was making a lovely pitter-patter sound as it fell onto the bridge of his nose, mixing in with her response.

"Please, come in," Odette's voice was melodic and serene, utterly devoid of surprise or suspicion.

Bastian pushed the door open with a hand that had hastily wiped away the droplets of water from his face. Odette was standing by the window, her figure bathed in the warm glow of the light that filtered into the room. The soft radiance lent a rosy tint to her pale complexion, making her appear all the more delicate and beautiful.

"What are you planning to say?" Odette asked, wrapping a delicate lace shawl around her slender shoulders.

"Nothing," Bastian responded, his answer catching her off guard. He crossed the room with heavy steps, his eyes heavy and bloodshot from exhaustion, even more so than they had been at dinner. His movements were sluggish and lethargic, a marked departure from his usual grace and poise.

"What brings you here then?" Odette struggled to maintain her composure, fighting to keep her emotions at bay. But with just one word, Bastian shattered the steely façade that she had erected around herself.

"To rest," 

Bastian walked over to the bed, and Odette's eyes widened as she realized the implications of his actions.

"You don't mean that we're supposed to share the same bed?"

"Why bother asking when you already know the answer?" Not wasting a moment as he clambered onto the bed and settled himself against the head cushion, his eyes fixed firmly on Odette.

"I... I don't understand," Odette protested, her face stiff with apprehension. After taking a deep breath to steady herself, she continued in a calm and measured tone. "I realized that due to the Crown Prince Belov's visit, the day when we must live together has been moved up. It's essential for us to appear more affectionate and friendly towards each other. However…" 

Bastian only revealed his actions to Odette after the fact. Although it was disrespectful of him to act without consulting her first, she chose not to voice her objection.

It would be sheer folly to invite ridicule by harping on the niceties of marital decorum, especially when the contract had already been signed and sealed. Employee and employer, after all.

Odette was determined to honor the boundaries that Bastian had set for their relationship. She refrained from prying into Sandrine's affairs and dutifully complied with any unilateral directives that came her way. 

"However?" Bastian murmured, his voice low and strained with fatigue as he gently closed his eyes. To Odette's surprise, he seemed utterly spent, another startling fact that left her puzzled.

"I'm happy to cooperate with you, Bastian, but is it really necessary?" Odette asked, offering her apologies as graciously as she could. "We've been using separate bedrooms for a while now, and there haven't been any disturbances or disruptions."

Bastian opened his eyes just as the weight of the silence between them grew heavier."What if an issue arises at the most crucial moment? Are you willing to take responsibility?" 

Odette paused for a moment, "Well, that's..." 

Bastian's gaze sharpened as he fixed his eyes on Odette, who found herself rendered speechless. "There may already be rumors circulating about the Klauswitz couple living in separate quarters. They just haven't gained enough traction yet to surface in the open."

Bastian leaned over to the bedside table and switched off the lamp, enveloping the room in darkness. The overwhelming weariness that had taken hold of him was now compounded by a throbbing headache, making him feel as though he were sinking into the depths of the ocean. Amidst the haze of his fatigue, the only clear image that he could discern was that of Odette standing in the faint glow of the moonlight.

"But... it's only natural for respectable couples to have separate bedrooms," Odette offered, after much contemplation.

"I wouldn't know, being a bastard and all," With a heavy thud, Bastian collapsed onto the bed, engulfed in the soft, sweet fragrance of Odette's body. "Who's to say that the grandson of an antique dealer can't be just as noble as you?" 

Odette's eyes flickered uncertainly at his lightly joke. "I didn't mean it like that. It's just that..."

"Let's continue this discussion tomorrow, Odette," Bastian interrupted, letting out a long, tired sigh and closing his eyes. He had reached his limit, and he knew that he was in no state to handle Odette's wrath. "I can't quite hear you now," he murmured softly, already half-asleep. "We'll pick up where we left off tomorrow."

"Bastian?" Odette's voice called out his name, growing steadily closer. Despite his efforts to rouse himself, Bastian found that his body was no longer under the control of his consciousness.

One step, then another. As the sound of approaching footsteps came to a halt, he felt a gentle hand shaking his shoulder with delicate care.

That was the last thing that Bastian could recall from that fateful night.



Duke Dyssen's eyes flicked open, without so much as a twitch of movement.

The caregiver returned to the hospital room just in time, only to be startled by the sight of the Duke's open eyes. Taken aback, he stepped back, causing the sound of a clattering tray and clinking cups to reverberate through the stillness of the night. In that moment, Duke Dyssen remained motionless, his gaze fixed unblinkingly on the ceiling overhead.

"Alright then. It couldn't have been a dream," Duke Dyssen muttered to himself, chuckling softly before suddenly turning his gaze towards the caregiver. "Raise me up immediately!"

A flash of anger crossed his face, causing his previous smile to vanish in an instant. Taken aback, the caregiver quickly raised Duke Dyssen and helped him to sit upright.

"I knew my memory wasn't failing me. That girl is the one who did this to me!" Duke Dyssen ranted, talking nonsense and causing a ruckus.

With a quiet, resigned sigh, the caregiver took a step back. It was the same commotion every single day, so there was nothing new about it. No one would have bothered to attend to the notorious patient had it not been for the generous compensation provided by his son-in-law.

"Did you have a nightmare? Would you like me to get you a sedative?" The caregiver offered up formal words of comfort, albeit with some reluctance. In the past, the Duke had been known to become even more angry and vicious in response to such inquiries, often resorting to profanity-laced outbursts. However, on this particular occasion, he seemed to be quieter than usual.

"Bring me pen and paper, quickly!" Duke Dyssen barked out the order, running his frustrated hand through his disheveled hair.

With a weary sigh, the caregiver quickly complied with the Duke's demand. As soon as the table with writing tools and paper was placed before him, Duke Dyssen pounced upon it like a famished predator, his bloodshot eyes glittering with a manic intensity.

In that moment, it was as if he had been transformed into a raving lunatic.

Unconcerned with the caregiver's departure, Duke Dyssen poured all of his energy into crafting his letter, his focus unbreakable.

"Tira. That damn bastard," Duke Dyssen muttered through heavy breaths as he tightened his grip on the pen. What had occurred that day was far from a mere accident, and the final pieces of his fragmented memory had now fallen into place.

He could recall with vivid clarity the feeling of Tira's hand shoving him with force, as well as the fact that Odette had been present on the stairs and had witnessed the entire scene. Despite this, both girls had kept their mouths firmly shut.

With dry, chapped lips, Duke Dyssen set about penning a letter seething with resentment and bitterness towards Tira.

It was absolutely unimaginable that Tira and Odette could have planned a plot together. Since none of them have the strength necessary to carry out such a scheme, it was obvious that a third person must have provided them with aid.

The most likely suspect was none other than the lowly grandson of the antique dealer, the man who had the nerve to marry Odette.

Yes, that had to be it. Duke Dyssen was certain of it.

As he gazed down at his immobilized leg, a wave of agony twisted his features into a mask of terrible pain.

Right after the accident had occurred, the man had wasted no time in proposing to Odette. To Duke Dyssen's dismay, she had accepted without hesitation, as if she had been anticipating the offer. He had later learned that Tira was attending a prestigious girls' school, while Odette was enjoying a life of luxury on the man's dime.

It had been a perfect, happy ending for everyone involved, except for Duke Dyssen himself, who remained confined to the hospital, tormented by his thoughts and suspicions. He was convinced that the trio of bastards had played a part in his downfall, but he couldn't understand why the pieces of his memory hadn't fallen into place sooner.

Duke Dyssen surveyed the room with a sense of apprehension, acutely aware of how much of his waking hours over the past few months had been spent under the influence of various drugs. What other secrets and conspiracies might be lurking in the shadows?

He knew that he needed to see Odette immediately, and the mere thought of her stirred a fierce determination within him. His hand trembled with a potent mixture of anger and adrenaline as he began to write frantically, the sound of the nib scratching against paper echoing through the stillness of the night.



The gentle warmth of the sunlight creeping over the edge of the bed roused Odette from her slumber, signaling the start of a morning unlike any other.

As she lay on her back, gazing up at the ceiling, her eyes were immediately drawn to the lazily swaying shadow cast by the shifting light.

The sunlight filtering in through the window felt noticeably softer than it had just a few weeks before, a subtle reminder that the seasons were beginning to shift once again. The crispness of the blanket and the pleasant warmth it provided were also telltale signs of the impending change.

As Odette lay there, taking in the fading sunlight and contemplating the arrival of autumn, she thought about the events of the previous night. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she closed her eyes, the memories still fresh in her mind.

‘Bastian’

The sound of her own voice, calling out the name  echoed through Odette's mind, jolting her awake from her drowsy state. But as she came to her senses, the sound of laughter filled her ears, causing her to wonder if it was all just a dream.

Slowly, she turned her head to the side, hoping against hope that the warmth she felt beside her and the sense of someone's gaze upon her was real. For so long, the bed beside hers had remained empty and cold.

Odette's eyes met Bastian's as he lounged on the bed, looking down at her. As she gazed into his piercing blue eyes, her mind began to clear, and memories of the previous night flooded back to her.

She remembered watching him fall asleep in the bed he had claimed as his own, feeling a mixture of frustration and confusion. But now, as she lay next to him once again, she could only feel a sense of curiosity and longing.

As Odette laid down next to Bastian, she felt uneasy and restless. She feared that her movements would disturb his slumber. After all, they had experienced the consequences of sleeping separately before, as seen during their stay at Demel's villa. Despite her despair, Odette resolved to endure and persevere through the night.

However, to her surprise, she fell into a deep, restful sleep like never before.

Odette's cheeks burned brighter as she caught a glimpse of Bastian's hand, rough and rugged yet gentle as it cradled her face. As he drew her gaze back to him, she fell for his piercing blue eyes. It was as if the world had faded into the background, leaving only the two of them in a moment frozen in time.

Bastian chuckled, his laughter filling the air as Odette bowed courteously to him. Her appearance became even more unkempt as a result of his playful tugging on her hair, which only made her more endearing.

It was a romantic moment that would have led anyone to believe that the couple was a blissful newlywed couple living the best of their lives, showered in love.

“Are you ready, madam?” Bastian asked abruptly, his laughter subsiding. 

Odette nodded in response, feeling compelled to do so despite her unease.


Chapter 50.
Real Honeymoon.



The Captain Klauswitz and his wife's sizzling honeymoon rapidly became the talk of the mansion. The recognized discord theory was no longer valid. It all seemed fake and a lie.

"I heard that last night they slept in the same bed?"

Everyone's attention was on the common room when the head maid, a hostess's assistant, appeared. Dora sat down and poured herself a cup of tea rather than responding with a sigh.

The immature maid's words added fuel to the already raging fire.

"Is it true that they kissed in front of everyone? Only our young master would do such a thing in front of the servants."

"It seems their relationship is not as everyone assumed. The rumors of a reluctant marriage due to pregnancy and living in separate rooms were all false. Perhaps the young master really loves the madam?" Dora responded calmly while sipping her tea.

“Otherwise, what other reason could there be?” 

Dora remained silent, but the chatter in the common room continued to escalate. She massaged her throbbing forehead and took a sip of her now-cold tea.

As Bastian settled into life in Ardene, he and Odette started each morning together. The first time their head maid caught a glimpse of them in the same bed, she nearly let out a scream of shock. She had never expected to see Bastian there.

However, as the days passed, the sight became more routine and mundane.

The intimacy between the man and woman who had spent the night together was unmistakable, yet they maintained their composure and grace. They appeared like any other sophisticated newlyweds, and it was startling to see that their once highly unconventional marriage was now becoming increasingly mundane and unremarkable, despite previously being the talk of the entire empire.

The maid nervously paced around the common room and cautiously asked, "What if the master truly cares for the madam?" This was the same girl who was scolded for laughing at the hostess on her wedding day.

Dora let out a deep sigh and touched her forehead as she replied, "If you wish to continue working here, please refrain from indulging in baseless speculation."

The events of this morning were far from ordinary, they transformed Dora's previously nebulous foreboding into a concrete certainty. Despite the familiar chime of the hostess's call bell, Dora braced herself and ascended the stairs with two steaming cups of tea and a newspaper in tow.

Dora focused intently on her duties, resisting the urge to pry into her master's personal affairs. Meanwhile, Bastian stirred from his slumber and flung open the window for a breath of fresh air. 

With his tousled robe haphazardly draped over his frame, he sauntered over to the table by the window where a pitcher of water sat. As he gazed upon his wife, time seemed to stand still, and he remained transfixed long after his glass was drained. It was as if he had become lost in the depths of his own contemplation.

Dora hovered tentatively a few paces away, biding her time for the opportune moment. Though she could have easily offered her salutations and made her exit, something held her back from speaking too hastily. Before long, Bastian strode away, leaving Dora feeling both relieved and bewildered by the encounter. Her sense of disorientation only deepened as she pondered the cryptic exchange.

Bastian strode confidently towards his wife's bedside, unwavering in his approach. Just as Odette set down her empty cup and raised her gaze, he drew near and lowered his head in a gesture of tenderness. Before she could fully grasp the significance of the moment, Bastian had already pressed his lips to her forehead in a gentle, fleeting kiss. Though the encounter was brief, its impact lingered in the air for long.

Bastian lavished his wife with a tender kiss before retreating to the bathroom, following his usual routine. The loving exchange left Dora feeling almost guilty, as if she had witnessed a moment of unguarded intimacy between the newlyweds. It was a scene straight out of a fairy tale, a sweet and romantic moment that made her heart flutter with warmth.

"I'm already out of the madam's line of sight, Head Maid Dora. What should I do now?" The maid's voice trembled with anxiety, jolting Dora from her reverie.

"Try not to worry too much. The mistress is unlikely to dwell on that incident any longer," 

Odette displayed an uncommon selflessness towards the servants who often sneered and snickered behind her back. It wasn't that she forgot their disdainful behavior, but rather that she chose not to dwell on it.

 Even after winning her husband's affection, Odette remained unchanged in her demeanor. As the daughter of a beggar princess, she had only been married to the master for a short while, yet Dora had already come to appreciate her refined and dignified nature, that her previous assumptions about Odette being a vulgar type proved themselves false. 

After consoling the anxious maid, Dora rose to attend to her duties. Just as she was about to depart, she caught sight of the young maid skulking out of the common room.

"Molly! Where are you off to? You still have work to do," Dora called out

"I'm just heading to the garden for a bit," Molly replied with a cheerful smile, her answer suggesting a carefree attitude. Despite being a recent addition to the staff, Molly was diligent in her work but tended to be idle and anxious during her free time.

"Looks like you're trying to slack off again," Dora accused.

"I'm not! I come from the countryside, and being surrounded by grass makes me feel better. It's the truth, ma'am," Molly replied, her frustration evident. "I only wanted to get some fresh air while the mistress is practicing the piano. You know perfectly well that I work hard from dawn until dusk."

"When are you going to learn proper manners and stop with this burlesque business?" Dora scolded the young maid, but her nodding head conveyed a hint of kindness.

Although being stubborn, the young maid was also intelligent, and with proper guidance, she could become a valuable senior servant.

Like a young colt full of excitement, Molly bolted out of the common room. Dora followed, leaving behind strict instructions for the other servants to keep quiet about the master and his wife's private affairs.

“Look at that. It's not like she's being idle.” Glancing around nonchalantly, Dora's laughter erupted when she caught a glimpse of Molly through the window. The young maid was sprinting into the depths of the forest, already far away from the garden.

With an intrigued expression, Dora followed the enchanting melody that echoed through the halls. It was as if the notes themselves were leading her towards the source of the music. She walked with a light step, feeling as though she was drawn to the solarium by some unseen force.



Bastian remarked with affection that she was an unfailingly tenacious woman. 

As he followed the lovely piano melody that resounded through the corridor every day and saw Odette at the end of it, his conviction was reinforced. Bastian discreetly sat down on the edge of a chaise lounge as he approached the solarium, ready to take in the symphonic ambiance that enveloped his wife.

The all-glass room sticking out into the ocean appeared to be a tropical paradise when bathed in the brilliant sunlight. Odette was seated in the middle of the room, totally engrossed in playing the white piano and utterly ignorant of his presence.

Odette labored nonstop from dawn until sunset, adhering to her own set of regulations with the high precision of a well-trained soldier. But unlike a soldier, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to each of the simple pleasures of reading, knitting, and playing the piano throughout the day.

In stark contrast to the life of poverty she had experienced only a few months before, Odette's interests were a tribute to her noble character. She was grounded and real despite her new-found riches, so it would be unfair to dismiss her goals as simple showmanship or vanity.

Bastian, on the other hand, was convinced of one thing even though he may not have fully understood the scope of Odette's desires.

The hostess's duties remained consistent, and Odette was a dedicated worker, always attentive to the upkeep of the estate, even tasks that could have been delegated to the butler or head maid. Along with her commitment to her work, her status within high society was gradually solidifying, without requiring extravagant expenditures.

As his wife practiced the piano, Bastian decided against announcing his presence and instead sat gently with his legs crossed. It appeared that something was not right when she began to look more and more serious.

At some point, Odette ceased playing and fixed her gaze on the sheet music with a determined expression. Retrieving the pencil she had earlier left on the music stand, she made a mark on the score to highlight a challenging section, and then meticulously studied the notes. With each tap of her fingers on the piano rim, she diligently established the rhythm, approaching the task as if she were cracking a complex code.

Bastian was awed by her stunning performance as she sang. Although other people might think her singing was just a dull hum, Bastian could hear her brilliance in every beautiful note.

Just as the memory of the starry night washed over Bastian's mind, reminiscent of the song of the sea witch, Odette turned her head slowly. The sudden sound of the pencil dropping in surprise was accompanied by her melodic voice calling out his name. It was as if every syllable was imbued with a musical resonance.

"When did you come in?" Odette asked.

Bastian gestured calmly towards the piano,  "Please, keep going. It sounds lovely."

After a brief moment of hesitation, Odette shook her head slightly and began to tidy up the sheet music. "Thank you for the compliment, but I am aware that I still have much to learn."

"Do you really think so?"

"Yes, it has been so long since I played the piano that my hands have become stiff." She finished arranging the sheet music and stood up from the piano. "When I become proficient enough to perform without feeling embarrassed, I will give you an official performance." Odette concluded the awkward conversation with empty pleasantries.

Bastian simply nodded in response and stood up from his chair with a cool demeanor.

"Did you complete your work successfully?" Odette broke the uncomfortable silence by changing the subject.

Later, as she began to practice the piano, Bastian retreated to his study to tend to his business affairs. Being a dedicated workaholic, it was not difficult to keep track of his busy lifestyle.

Bastian lightly tapped his chin, "Well, more or less." He took a step forward, causing the distance between them to narrow gradually, like the sound of waves drifting in through the window.

However, just as the gap between them became close enough for their shadows to meet, the butler appeared.

"The horses have arrived, master.” Lovis informed him, “They are settling in their new paddock. Would you like to see it for yourself?"

"Okay," Bastian replied absentmindedly. Despite conversing with Lovis, his gaze was still fixed on Odette. It was apparent that he was not content with the embarrassing rumors that had already circulated throughout the mansion.

Bastian abruptly wrapped his arms around Odette's waist  "Do you know how to ride a horse?" 

Although feeling breathless, Odette managed to maintain a smile on her face, pretending to be a loving wife.

"A little bit," she replied briefly. 

The response sounded absurd to her, but it was the only answer she could give.


Chapter 51.
I'll Follow Behind You.



Odette gazed at the pasture with a slightly puzzled expression. Several horses were casually roaming around the vast meadow that was enclosed by a white fence. Although she knew the stable was located around the area, it was her first time visiting it.

"Master, madam, are you here?" called out the stable workers as they hurried to greet them.

As Bastian conversed with the stable keeper, Odette took a closer look at the pasture. Although she didn't know much about horses, it was evident to her that all the horses in the stable had exceptional pedigrees.

Odette was awestruck by the sight before her, but Bastian's voice calling her name brought her back to reality. As she approached her husband, the stable keeper arrived with a snow-white horse.

"This is Shune, madam," the stable keeper informed Odette. "She's a three-year-old mare, but very docile and clever. You won't find it difficult to handle." After the brief explanation, Bastian was handed the reins.

"Let me know if you don't feel confident. I'll buy you a pony to practice on." Bastian said.

Odette shook her head and walked towards the white mare. "I learned to ride horses when I was a child, but it's been a long time, so I might have lost the feel of it."

"When was the last time you rode a horse?" 

"I think it's been about six years." She fed a sugar cube to the horse offered by a stable worker, displaying her natural ease in handling the animal. It appeared that teaching her the basics would not be necessary as she seemed quite adept at it.

“There are no saddles available for women. Are you all right with that? “Bastian asked

“Yes. I've previously ridden in her father's saddle. Although my mother detested it, I preferred it that way." Odette rubbed the horse's mane while softly grinning. Bastian was made aware of who this woman was by the sight.

Her mother was a princess even though she was a sinner and lived in exile.

If Duke Dyssen had not succumbed to his vain greed, she would have led a life of comfort, supported by the money raised by selling her jewels and the favor of her relatives abroad. As a distinguished hostess of a prestigious aristocratic family or even as the Queen of a foreign royal family, the future that Duke Dyssen had envisioned for his daughter could have been within her reach.

"All right, let's take a ride." Bastian flashed a glance after getting rid of his pointless thoughts, and the stable keeper moved the footrest.

Odette mounted the horse with ease, despite her improper attire. Her movements were graceful and nimble, and her posture was impeccable, revealing her natural athleticism.

As Bastian led the horse with Odette on its back, they walked slowly through the pasture. At first, Odette appeared nervous, but soon she regained her confidence from her childhood memories. The horse seemed to have no problem carrying her weight and even seemed to enjoy it.

Bastian moved away from the action and stood back to observe. Odette took the reins and slowly guided the horse around the huge meadow. She felt considerably more assured by the time she made it back to Bastian's side.

"It appears that the madam is not in need of a pony.” The eyes of the stable staff widened as they noticed Odette progressively gaining speed.

"I believe we've practiced enough. How do you feel about it?" Bastian proposed.

 Odette's eyes widened with surprise and joy, resembling that of a child receiving an unexpected gift. In response, Bastian motioned with his chin, prompting the workers to open the fence gate.

"Go ahead and run free," 

Bastian  directed his gaze towards the other side of the road that led into the forest. As Odette's eyes fixated in that direction, a mixture of excitement and apprehension was visible in her expression. 

"You don't have to worry, Odette. I'll follow behind you."

As Bastian calmly reassured her, Odette's expression transformed into one of relief. Her smile, unguarded and fresh, conveyed a sense of liberation, a departure from the burden of worldly concerns that had previously weighed her down.

Without hesitation, she took hold of the reins and urged her horse to pass through the wide-open gate. Gradually increasing their pace, they ventured deeper into the forest until Odette began to run with fervor. Bastian, observing her abandon all conventions, understood why she had no regard for riding in a lady's saddle.

Over the wooded path lined with trees rising far into the sky, the sound of horses' hooves started to reverberate. The branches with overgrown leaves rippled as the birds took flight after being startled by the presence. The shadows cast by the sunlight moved in time with that beat, resembling the intricate lace that Odette meticulously wove each night.

In order to gain a wide-angle perspective of the surroundings, Bastian kept a close enough distance as he followed Odette. The ribbons holding her hair in place came undone right as the breeze started to carry a stronger sea scent.

Like a bird taking flight, the white ribbon soared through the air and quickly vanished into the dense forest. Odette, caught off guard by its sudden departure, slowed her pace and turned her head in its direction. Realizing it was irretrievable, she refocused her attention ahead and continued her run.

The striking contrast between her luscious black tresses and pristine white attire heightened the significance of the moment, etching it into memory.

Bastian glanced at Odette, who had suddenly become alien, and his eyes progressively grew smaller. In the meantime, the forest's edge was drawing near. Odette was running towards the light and he made the hasty decision to catch up with her.

The two horses simultaneously stepped into the brilliant sunlight and began running side by side. Horse hooves galloping along with the soft sound of the waves lapping against the sandy beach.

As they rode along the trail that followed the border between the woodland and the sea, Bastian's attention was fixed on the woman who shone like the sun the entire time.



Theodora gingerly broke the seal on the envelope. The words scrawled inside were a chaotic jumble of misspelled words and illegible handwriting, but she managed to glean some sense of the message.

"It's fanciful, not at all like Bastian," remarked Theodora with a chuckle, as she meticulously perused the letter that had been handed to her by the maid.

After some time had passed, Bastian finally settled into his grandiose new mansion and began ostentatiously sharing his bed with his wife, as if flaunting their intimacy for all to see. This was the essence of the tale, replete with vivid descriptions of their extravagant displays of affection, which were both astonishing and nonsensical.

The news may not have been precisely what was anticipated, but it did serve to validate the efficacy of the spy who had been planted next to Bastian's wife. This information would prove useful in the foreseeable future.

"Your recommendation was spot on, and I'm glad I followed it. Nancy, your niece Molly is exceptionally astute. I'm delighted with her," exclaimed Theodora, as she discarded the shredded letter and commended the diligent efforts of her maid, beaming with a gentle smile.

The countenance of the other maid, who stood alongside her, soured visibly, but Theodora paid her no heed.

These two seasoned maids had been faithful servants of the family since their parents' time, and they played a significant role in eliminating the daughter of the antique dealer, who happened to be Bastian's biological mother. With their unswerving loyalty and invaluable contributions, it was evident that they were now entirely devoted to Theodora.

In their zealous pursuit of their mistress's favor, the two maids had become fierce adversaries, but this cutthroat rivalry worked to Theodora's advantage. Their fierce competition spurred them on to perform exceptionally well, demonstrating their competence and trustworthiness time and time again.

"Even as a young child, Molly had shown remarkable intelligence. If I retain her services, I'm certain she'll be a great asset," said Theodora, praising Nancy's niece. Nancy's face lit up with happiness upon hearing the compliment.

"How can you consider employing a child whose visage has already been peddled as a potential housemaid?" Susan interjected, her tone sharp and critical. Dejected by the rebuke, she glared at Theodora, who was watching the tension unfold with a serene expression.

Theodora rose to her feet, gesturing dismissively with her hand. "My dear Susan, I have my own methods for evaluating a person's worth. Rest assured, Molly's past is of no consequence to me," she replied calmly.

"I haven't hired Molly officially as my personal assistant, so there's no need to worry. I'll find another role for her," Theodora reassured Nancy, then turned to address Susan. "However, we must keep a watchful eye on Duke Dyssen's daughter. Do you think Molly is up to the task?" she asked, acknowledging the concerns of both maids.

Once the two women fell silent, Theodora made her way over to the window and pulled aside the heavy curtains, revealing a magnificent view of Bastian's new mansion on the other side of the bay.

As she watched Bastian perform for the emperor, she thought if he was genuinely serious or merely putting on a show. This wasn't the same Bastian she had known before. He was never one to make rash decisions for love, or at least, that was the impression she had always had of him. In fact, she couldn't be sure if he even understood what love truly meant.

Carl Illis, Bastian's grandfather, had once accused them of destroying the boy, but such an accusation was far-fetched. After all, Bastian had never been a typical child, with his unnervingly still gaze and other peculiarities.

As she gazed into Bastian's eyes, it felt as if she was being drawn into a dark abyss, devoid of any glimmer of hope.

She knew that the young man before her had endured years of hardship and struggle, and she admired him for his tenacity and resilience.

But as she reminisced about the boy she had known before, the one she had pushed to the brink time and time again, she felt a twinge of disgust. How could she have treated him so harshly? How had he become so strong despite her actions? These were questions she couldn't answer.

While Jeff Klauswitz may have been pleased that the antique dealer had taken his grandson with him, Theodora held a different perspective. She believed that even if it meant risking scandal, she would have preferred to stay within the walls of the mansion. Had she done so, she would have been spared the terrible disgrace she had endured.

Bastian was once like a helpless cub that they had released into the wild in order to protect their family's honor. But he returned as a fierce and savage beast, causing people to hold their breath in awe. His mouth hung open, revealing sharp fangs.

Instructing Nancy with a cold voice, Theodora commanded her to be cautious and keep a close eye on what captivates Bastian's wife. Pouring herself a generous serving of brandy, she sank back into her chair, drowning herself in the potent drink. "Perhaps Nancy can cozy up to that beggar princess and become her confidante," she mused, her laughter ringing out sharply.

Theodora took another sip and pondered whether it would be horrible if everything in the hidden letter were true.

Perhaps, there were no better manacles than love.


Chapter 52.
Lowly Man.



As Bastian entered Odette's room, he felt as if he was crossing a threshold into a different world. The faint sound of water running from the bathroom only added to the eerie silence that enveloped the space, amplified by the closed door that separated their bedrooms.

Despite the late hour, the room was as bright as day, flooded with light that seemed to emanate from every corner. He wondered if Odette preferred the brightness, a stark contrast to his own minimalistic lighting preferences.

With each step he took, Bastian felt himself moving deeper into the light, as if being pulled towards a source of power and energy that he couldn't resist any more.

Upon closer inspection, the hostess's bedroom had not undergone many changes since the interior decorator had worked on it. It appeared to be a bit disordered at first glance, but the majority of the items had been present since the beginning. There were few things that could be deemed as belonging to Odette, leaving a sense of emptiness in the space that was meant to be hers.

The room was meticulously arranged, yet it lacked vitality, appearing more like a place that could be abandoned at a moment's notice. It resembled the interior of an officer's quarters or a cabin on a warship.

 As Bastian scanned the room, his eyes fell upon the dressing table and the collection of glass bottles atop it. He paused at the sight of a gold comb, engraved with the fancy initials "H," which was undoubtedly Odette's prized possession.

The princess only left her daughter with an old comb. It demonstrated just how much Duke Dyssen had damaged the lives of his family.

Bastian placed the comb back where it belonged and moved gently in the direction of the bed. He heard a knock as he came to a stop in front of a bed bench with a scarf and gown nicely folded.

The butler bowed and presented the letter he had brought for the madam. Bastian's expression remained placid as he took it, but a faint crease formed on his forehead as he recognized the sender's name. The Duke of Dissen, previously confined to the hospital, had reached out to them.

Bastian strode towards the table beside the window, holding the letter in hand. He retrieved a cigarette and lit it, his gaze remained fixated on the envelope, the smoke from his cigarette swirled around him. 

It was almost comical how many words he still had left to say to his daughter, but Bastian knew what he had to do. With a boldness that felt like exercising a natural right, he opened the envelope and unfolded the letter with no faint trace of hesitation.

Duke Dyssen's letter was a blatant display of his disdain towards his daughter and son-in-law. His usual pleasantries were conspicuously absent, replaced with a barrage of scathing remarks aimed at their "disgraceful" marriage and the "lowly" man he had associated with.

The large sheet of paper was densely packed with curses and reprimands, spitting his extreme anger and frustration at having his previous letters ignored.

Bastian casually tossed aside the letter, finding it unworthy of further attention. He took a deep drag from his cigarette, pondering the unfortunate circumstance that only the Duke's back was broken. It would have been more satisfying if his wrists were also fractured, preventing him from ever penning such drivel again.

After extinguishing his cigarette, Bastian stood up holding the letter in his hand and a lighter. As soon as the bathroom door opened, he hurled the lighted letter into the fireplace.



Odette strode towards the dressing table with a bright smile, accompanied by her trusty maid. Her demeanor had shifted, no longer displaying the same level of surprise and panic as earlier. Meanwhile, Bastian calmly inspected the remnants of the letter, now reduced to a pile of ashes. Once satisfied, he settled onto the bed, facing the dressing table with a leisurely air.

As the young maid carefully dried her  hair, Odette meticulously applied a substance from a beautifully adorned glass jar onto her face. As she opened a pottery bottle adorned with violets, their eyes met in the mirror.

Odette averted her gaze, hoping Bastian would succumb to slumber as he usually did, but to no avail. He remained motionless, showing no signs of retiring for the night.

She gave up on her futile dreams and resumed working. After carefully applying the cream she had taken out of the bottles, she put the bottles back in their original position. Moving right to left, according to the use. She had picked up the behavior from her mother.

"Madam, I have completed my duties and will take my leave now," the maid announced politely.

After the maid left to tidy up the bathroom, Molly approached and respectfully lowered her head.

Odette was worried about being left alone, but she was at a loss for how to justify keeping them around any longer. At that very moment, the door squeaked open and shut once more, but Bastian remained seated in the same position, looking at Odette in the mirror.

Sensing an obligation to break the silence, Odette searched for a suitable topic to broach. Although she was genuinely curious about the letter Bastian had torched, she decided against raising the matter and risking a discordant atmosphere. Furthermore, she had a hunch about the contents of the letter, and thus saw no reason to hear Sandrine's name uttered from Bastian's lips once more.

Despite her desire to recline, Odette found herself unable to relinquish the comb, owing to Bastian's persistent presence. The unyielding silence weighed heavily on her, and the task of brushing her seemingly interminable locks provided some semblance of distraction. Meanwhile, Bastian observed the spectacle with an air of nonchalance, as though he were a spectator at a captivating performance.

Truly, he was an enigmatic and dominating figure, unlike any other.

…………..

Even after Bastian emerged from the shower, Odette remained steadfast at the dressing table, vigorously brushing her hair without respite.

 He chuckled softly before retiring to bed, cognizant of the fact that she was the type of woman who would continue brushing her hair all night if he didn't lie down first. While her tenacity was perplexing, he resolved to respect her wishes and accommodate her accordingly. After all, he had no desire to engage in a futile altercation.

Bastian tightened his gown and reclined on the bed, shutting his eyes in the process. After a while, Odette ceased her hair brushing and rose from her seat, moving with a grace and silence that belied her presence. Despite her quietude, Bastian was acutely aware of her movements.

Odette proceeded to perform her customary bedtime routine, traversing the room and extinguishing the various sources of light. Electric chandeliers, wall lamps, oil lamps, and candelabras all succumbed to her touch, culminating in a state of near-total darkness.

The lights dimmed one by one until the bedroom was completely in the black. Odette finally shut off her nightlight and stepped cautiously towards the bed. She initially thought that the bed's extra width made people feel lonely, but after sharing it with a large man, she had a change of heart.

Odette lay on his side and drew the covers up to her chin, relishing the warmth of the bed that was suffused with Bastian's body heat. The sensation reminded her of bygone times when she slept soundly with Tira nestled in her embrace. Desiring to avoid indulging in futile nostalgia, Odette promptly shut her eyes and attempted to fall asleep. But as moments stretched into minutes, her consciousness sharpened rather than diminished.

Odette slowly tilted her head towards the side next to her after opening her eyes in resignation. She had assumed Bastian had dozed off, but he was startlingly alert. His eyes were filled with Odette, who was as silent as the night.

"Sleep evading you?" Odette asked, her voice steadier than her racing heart.

Bastian responded with a smile, "And you?" Thankfully, his demeanor was not as disagreeable as earlier.

Odette released her guard and exhaled a lengthy sigh before nodding. "I'm exhausted, yet I can't seem to sleep peacefully." She placed her hands on her chest and gazed up at the ceiling. "Thank you for your hard work today, Bastian."

Odette expressed her gratitude, her gaze still fixed on the darkness outside.

"I'm grateful to you for today. Riding a horse after such a long time was wonderful. It reminded me of my childhood."

"Would you like to go back to that time?" Bastian asked.

Odette hesitated for a moment, "It's just a pointless assumption."

She turned her head with a graceful tilt, smoothly changing the subject to safer and more superficial topics such as the current weather, social trends, and their schedule for the month.

"Perhaps we could invite Lord Xanders to the garden party we have planned for this weekend?" Odette proposed, flashing a rare and genuine smile as she faced Bastian once more.

"The botanist, Xanders?"

"Yes, that's the one. The Xanders family also has a villa in Ardene, and I heard that they were there last weekend. He expressed interest in dining with us if we ever extended an invitation," 

“Why is it that we now need to add a name that wasn't on the invitation list?” Bastian asked.

"The aristocratic Xanders family has consistently occupied the front row of the Imperial Nobility Yearbook. Becoming friends with him will help you get noticed in the social scene." 

Odette wasn't easily deterred, not even by Bastian's cold-hearted protest. Her demeanour amply demonstrated her confidence in and kindness towards Maximin von Xanders.

Who the hell is assisting who, exactly?

Bastian found Odette's graciousness intriguing, but he remained silent. After all, it was her responsibility as the hostess to make such decisions. As long as there was no specific reason to object, he had no interest in questioning her choice of guests.

Odette proceeded to discuss the party's schedule and menu options, but Bastian found the conversation tedious. Her voice had grown noticeably drowsy by the time she finished her report on the matter.

"I think it's time for me to sleep now," Odette whispered softly, slowly opening her closed eyes. Her dense lashes cast a shadow over her reddened eyes as they fluttered. "Goodnight, Bastian."

With a gentle gaze, Bastian watched Odette as she drifted off into a peaceful slumber, her breaths deep and steady. She appeared very youthful and serene, free from the weight of the world that had burdened her tired eyes earlier that day. It reminded him of the way she had spoken earlier, of feeling transported back to a time of fond memories and nostalgia.

As he observed Odette sleeping peacefully, Bastian let himself drown in the sea of thoughts about her future. 

The future that lay ahead of her after this marriage. 

He knew she was intelligent and principled, but the weight of her father's expectations and the burden of their family's finances had dragged her down into a dark abyss. However, if only she could break free from these shackles and carve her own path, she had the potential to live a life more stable and prosperous than anyone else. 

With the possibility of a proper marriage and starting a new family, perhaps even as a labeled divorcee, Odette could potentially find herself in the position of a second wife within a moderately prestigious aristocratic family. As the future Countess Xanders, for instance, she could fulfill the role quite fittingly. While Bastian acknowledged that such a life could suit her well, a feeling of discontent stirred within him.

As Odette slept, she shifted closer to Bastian, sensing the faint warmth of his breath. The scent of her skin grew stronger as their bodies drew nearer.

Bastian delicately swept away the strands of hair that obscured Odette's face and neck. His gentle touch was as tender as velvet, he noticed the unexpected softness of her skin beneath his fingertips.

He wondered if she was the kind of person who trusted others too easily. As he watched her peacefully slumbering form, a crooked smile tugged at the corners of his lips.

It was a far cry from her defensive and prickly demeanor, yet it still made him uneasy in its own way.

Bastian heaved a deep sigh, the kind that was heavy with both resignation and desire, before reluctantly getting up from the bed. He reached for the cigarette box on the nearby table and the sound of its lid being opened was soon followed by the flick of a lighter.

With his back against the moonlit window, he took a long drag from the cigarette and let out a low chuckle as he looked down at the noticeable bulge in his pants.

As he exhaled the blue smoke along with a string of curses, his wife remained deep in peaceful slumber, oblivious to the stirrings of her husband's passion.


Chapter 53.
Ordinary Family.


Duke Dyssen, with an air of anger, asked once more, "Did the letter not arrive?" seemingly forgetting that he had already been given the same answer on multiple occasions.

The caregiver politely responded with restraint, "I can assure you, Your Grace, that no letter was delivered to you."

The Duke had always babbled nonsense when he first awoke, but lately his condition had gotten worse. The caretaker was really concerned that he might need to be admitted to a mental health ward.

"There must be some mistake. Please go down and check it again. And this time, make sure to check thoroughly." Dyssen insisted,

"I understand your concern, but I've already checked three times - yesterday and the two days prior."

 The caregiver's voice, trying to soothe Dyssen, was tinged with irritation that couldn't be concealed. Although he was a Duke, a member of the nobility convalescing in a high-end hospital, the truth was that he was nothing more than an abandoned invalid. 

At first, he even raged at his daughter for her absence, but it didn't take long for him to reconsider. He realized that his daughter had already shown immense strength and fortitude simply by staying in his life, even after cutting ties with him.

"Did they have the audacity to ignore me, knowing who I am?" The Duke's anger made him tremble as he shouted.

The cycle repeated itself once again.

The caregiver, struggling to find the right words, tiptoed back into the room, considering a swift exit before the Duke erupted in fury. If only she could manage to sedate him and put him to sleep, she could make it through another day without incident.

"Tira, that foolish girl, could never have come up with this on her own. It's clear that Odette convinced her to do it - 'let's get rid of father and live happily ever after.' They intended to kill me. If I had fallen any harder, I would have died on the spot." His words turned into sobs, causing the caregiver to freeze in shock.

"He destroyed Odette," the Duke continued, his anger boiling over. "It's all because of that despicable man. What kind of hero is he? He's the devil who ruined my life just so he could marry Odette!" With that, he began to strike at his crippled leg.

Realizing that the Duke couldn't be left in his current state, the caregiver pressed the call button and requested the assistance of the medical staff. Within a short while, a doctor arrived, accompanied by a group of burly guards.

"Release me! Bring my daughter to me immediately! Bring me Odette!" 

Duke Dyssen thrashed about, even as the guards pinned him down. His struggles continued unabated, fueled by a monstrous strength that belied his frail and withered body. 

The caregiver retreated to the safety of a corner, observing the chaos, frightened. The Duke frantically searched for his daughter, until he was subdued with a sedative and slipped into unconsciousness. This was a different kind of rage than what she had witnessed in the past - not simply a pessimism regarding his personal situation, but a fierce and consuming anger that threatened to consume everything in its path.

As she listened to the Duke's ravings, the caregiver found herself contemplating the unthinkable – Could it really be his daughter? Had his daughter truly been the cause of his madness? It was a dangerous thought, and one that she knew she couldn't trust blindly, especially coming from a man who was half-mad himself.

The sedative took effect quickly, and soon the Duke was sound asleep. The medical staff departed, leaving behind an uncanny silence engulfing the room.

As she cleaned up the Duke's room, the caregiver let out a frustrated sigh. "I can't keep doing this every day," she muttered to herself. "It's like a never-ending war."

She surveyed the damage caused by the Duke's latest outburst - broken fixtures and furniture strewn about the room - and resigned herself to the fact that it would all need to be replaced, thanks to the deep pockets of the despised son-in-law, Bastian. It was a luxury the Duke enjoyed, even as he raged against the man who provided for him. 

Despite the Duke's persisting anger towards his son-in-law and daughter, the caregiver couldn't help but feel suspicious. As she exited the room, her exhausted body was plagued with an overwhelming sense of curiosity.

Although there was still an hour before the next caregiver was scheduled to take over, she contemplated leaving early to ensure she wouldn't be late for lunch. After all, the Duke would be sleeping all day, so she saw no harm in finishing her shift a bit earlier.

Yes. Patients who are overcome with despair and melancholy must have a special sense of victimization. The caretaker fought all the way to the city center on the train, but she was only able to get to that conclusion.

Working for the Duke was a precarious situation, but the high salary made it hard to pass up. It was best to tread carefully and avoid getting involved in his personal issues, as there was little to gain and much to lose by doing so.

As the train pulled into the center of Ratz, she realized she had arrived at her destination. With a clear mind, she stepped off the train, feeling much more at ease. Suddenly, she heard her name being called.

“Susan!” Looking up, she saw her sister standing at the nearby bus stop, and a wide smile spread across her face.



"Seems like I was needlessly concerned. Captain Klauswitz's party went off without a hitch." 

Countess Trier smiled at Odette. The breathtaking coastal landscape of Ardene may have been the star of the show, but it was Odette, the hostess of the grand mansion, who added the perfect touch of elegance and sophistication. 

Every detail of the luncheon, from the exquisitely arranged table that blended in with the sea-facing garden to the seasonal menu that tantalized the taste buds of the guests, and even the seating plan that took into account the social status and bonds between them, was executed flawlessly. Truly, it was an exquisitely beautiful affair.

"You've transformed into a whole different person in just one season. You're a fine lady, I suppose it's not too much to say." Countess Trier exclaimed. The cries of seagulls flying low over the water mixed with the compliment. "I imagine you've already forgotten how I used to call the Countess every day and bug her since I didn't know anything," she said. 

Odette smiled softly as she regarded the sandy shore. As the warm sun beat down on the beach, the guests scattered in different directions to enjoy the afternoon activities. 

The adventurous ones headed out to sea on sleek yachts, slicing through the waves with the wind in their hair. Others opted to lounge on the sandy shores, soaking up the sun's rays and dipping their toes in the refreshing water. For those looking for a bit of exercise, a stroll along the beach offered stunning views of the sparkling ocean and towering cliffs in the distance. It was a perfect afternoon of leisure and excitement for all.

Countess Trier lauded Odette's achievement with just a few words of advice, hailing it as a talent deserving of praise. She emphasized that one couldn't fabricate or hide their bloodline, and that Odette's innate abilities were proof of her royal heritage. In a confident tone, she expressed her belief that if lineage was the sole determining factor, then surely Odette should have inherited more from her father.

With a disillusioned question on her mind, Odette chose to respect the grateful old lady's wishes by refraining from contradicting her. She didn't want to spoil such a beautiful day by bringing up her father. Additionally, there was a significant reason why she wasn't prepared to contemplate her father yet - she had forsaken him for Tira.

Even though Odette didn't look back on the decision she made that day, she couldn't shake the remorse and debt she carried in her heart. Perhaps she would have to live the rest of her life carrying a debt from her heart. It was the agony of Odette.

Countess Trier let out a disapproving click of her tongue and set down her half-empty champagne glass, urging Odette to leave the table of mostly elderly guests sitting under the white awning. She believed it was a waste of time for a young lady as lovely as Odette to engage in conversations with such dull and uninteresting people.

As the Countess Trier was about to speak, a young man appeared, but Odette interrupted her by shaking her head "No. I like it here." She gazed out at the picturesque sandy beach, enjoying the view.

Countess Trier cast a concerned look at Maxime, who arrived carrying his daughter in his arms. "I doubt your daughter will ever learn to walk on her own, Count Xanders," she commented with a furrowed brow. 

Maxime responded calmly with a smile, "She's still a baby. Please don't be too hard on her." He then took the empty seat beside Odette.

Countess Trier stepped back, her face displaying disapproval. She did so since she was fully aware of how much Maximin loved and cared for his wife. It was also true that he had given his daughter all of the love that had wandered off course.

As Maxime and Odette strolled through the garden, Maxime deeply noticed the impressive landscaping. After taking a moment to admire it, he glanced over at Odette and brought up a fitting topic of conversation.

"It's really lovely here," Maxime commented. "The attention to detail is impressive."

"Yes, it's all thanks to Lord Xanders' advice. I know it's getting late, but I still want to thank you again for all of your help. Thank you for the recommendation." Odette said gratefully.

Maxime shook his head modestly. "You're welcome, but I must give credit where credit is due. Mrs. Klauswitz actually found the right answer."

As the two of them exchanged pleasantries, Countess Trier observed them closely. She left amazed at how she noticed the striking similarities between them. They had a quiet and refined presence about them that gave off an aura of elegance. Upon closer inspection, she realized they even had similar personalities and interests. It was as if they were brother and sister.

The thought crossed her mind of how lovely it would be for Odette to have a partner as charming as Maxime. However, she quickly dismissed the notion as nonsensical and unwarranted.

"Oh, it looks like your husband is returning," Countess Trier remarked, using her fan to gesture towards the sea.

As Odette played with Count Xanders' daughter, she heard the sound of a yacht slicing through the brilliantly sparkling water. She turned her head slowly towards the direction of the boat, curious to see who it might be.

To her surprise, she recognized the familiar golden initials engraved on the side of the yacht –K

 It was Bastian's ship.



Observing the crowd of guests, Bastian noticed a young couple with a small child who appeared to be just like any ordinary family. It was a rare sight among the attendees at the event.

With that thought in mind, Bastian made his way towards the beach awning. His fellow officers who had disembarked with him followed suit. It was time for them to take a break, relax, and spend some quality time with their loved ones before heading back into the mansion.

A fireworks show would round off the dinner and festivities. It was all that remained after the incident. Bastian was confident that it would be ideal as well. It was his wife's belief in him that gave him the confidence.

Odette did a good job as the hostess.

He no longer appeared to question that reality. The woman had transformed into a socialite in a matter of months from being little more than a target of sympathy and hate until last spring. As if that were the way things always happened. She resembled a queen who had led a magnificent life all of her life.

Bastian had a fondness for the coronation he had purchased with his own funds. He believed that if the world hadn't bestowed it upon him, he would have found a way to acquire it himself. There was something alluring about wearing a sparkling crown and ruling from a magnificent golden throne, no matter the cost.

"Bastian," Odette's voice interrupted his thoughts.

As Bastian searched for Odette among the crowd, he became increasingly perplexed by her absence. However, just as he was beginning to worry, he heard a familiar voice.

Turning his head, Bastian saw the family he had passed earlier. The woman who had been seated with a child in her arms was now standing, accompanied by the man who had been sitting next to her.

Bastian's lips curved into a smile when he recognized the couple as Odette and Maxime, whom he had previously assumed were married.

"Captain Klauswitz, did you enjoy the voyage?" Maxime was the first to break the silence. Bastian turned towards the voice, his expression stoic and composed. Despite exchanging formal pleasantries, his senses remained fixated on Odette, who was cradling someone else's child with great care.

The tense atmosphere dissipated when the child was abruptly taken from Odette's arms and returned to Maxime's care, ending the delicate confrontation.

"Mommy!" The child's voice rang out suddenly, calling out to Odette.

As Bastian wrapped his arm around his wife's waist,  the Count's daughter began to cry uncontrollably. Maxime and Odette were taken aback by the sudden outburst, their faces flushing with embarrassment. The other guests seated around the table shared a similar reaction.

Despite the awkwardness of the situation, the child continued to sob, calling out to Odette as "mom" repeatedly and with increasing desperation. Her cries were so loud and piercing that they echoed across the sandy beach.


Chapter 54.
An Affair.

"Did the letter not arrive?"

Duke Dyssen, with an air of anger, asked once more, seemingly forgetting that he had already been given the same answer on multiple occasions.

The caregiver politely responded with restraint, "I can assure you, Your Grace, that no letter was delivered to you."

The Duke had always babbled nonsense when he first awoke, but lately his condition had gotten worse. The caretaker was really concerned that he might need to be admitted to a mental health ward.

"There must be some mistake. Please go down and check it again. And this time, make sure to check thoroughly." Dyssen insisted,

"I understand your concern, but I've already checked three times - yesterday and the two days prior."

 The caregiver's voice, trying to soothe Dyssen, was tinged with irritation that couldn't be concealed. Although he was a Duke, a member of the nobility convalescing in a high-end hospital, the truth was that he was nothing more than an abandoned invalid. 

At first, he even raged at his daughter for her absence, but it didn't take long for him to reconsider. He realized that his daughter had already shown immense strength and fortitude simply by staying in his life, even after cutting ties with him.

"Did they have the audacity to ignore me, knowing who I am?" The Duke's anger made him tremble as he shouted.

The cycle repeated itself once again.

The caregiver, struggling to find the right words, tiptoed back into the room, considering a swift exit before the Duke erupted in fury. If only she could manage to sedate him and put him to sleep, she could make it through another day without incident.

"Tira, that foolish girl, could never have come up with this on her own. It's clear that Odette convinced her to do it - 'let's get rid of father and live happily ever after.' They intended to kill me. If I had fallen any harder, I would have died on the spot." His words turned into sobs, causing the caregiver to freeze in shock.

"He destroyed Odette," the Duke continued, his anger boiling over. "It's all because of that despicable man. What kind of hero is he? He's the devil who ruined my life just so he could marry Odette!" With that, he began to strike at his crippled leg.

Realizing that the Duke couldn't be left in his current state, the caregiver pressed the call button and requested the assistance of the medical staff. Within a short while, a doctor arrived, accompanied by a group of burly guards.

"Release me! Bring my daughter to me immediately! Bring me Odette!" 

Duke Dyssen thrashed about, even as the guards pinned him down. His struggles continued unabated, fueled by a monstrous strength that belied his frail and withered body. 

The caregiver retreated to the safety of a corner, observing the chaos, frightened. The Duke frantically searched for his daughter, until he was subdued with a sedative and slipped into unconsciousness. This was a different kind of rage than what she had witnessed in the past - not simply a pessimism regarding his personal situation, but a fierce and consuming anger that threatened to consume everything in its path.

As she listened to the Duke's ravings, the caregiver found herself contemplating the unthinkable – Could it really be his daughter? Had his daughter truly been the cause of his madness? It was a dangerous thought, and one that she knew she couldn't trust blindly, especially coming from a man who was half-mad himself.

The sedative took effect quickly, and soon the Duke was sound asleep. The medical staff departed, leaving behind an uncanny silence engulfing the room.

As she cleaned up the Duke's room, the caregiver let out a frustrated sigh. "I can't keep doing this every day," she muttered to herself. "It's like a never-ending war."

She surveyed the damage caused by the Duke's latest outburst - broken fixtures and furniture strewn about the room - and resigned herself to the fact that it would all need to be replaced, thanks to the deep pockets of the despised son-in-law, Bastian. It was a luxury the Duke enjoyed, even as he raged against the man who provided for him. 

Despite the Duke's persisting anger towards his son-in-law and daughter, the caregiver couldn't help but feel suspicious. As she exited the room, her exhausted body was plagued with an overwhelming sense of curiosity.

Although there was still an hour before the next caregiver was scheduled to take over, she contemplated leaving early to ensure she wouldn't be late for lunch. After all, the Duke would be sleeping all day, so she saw no harm in finishing her shift a bit earlier.

Yes. Patients who are overcome with despair and melancholy must have a special sense of victimization. The caretaker fought all the way to the city center on the train, but she was only able to get to that conclusion.

Working for the Duke was a precarious situation, but the high salary made it hard to pass up. It was best to tread carefully and avoid getting involved in his personal issues, as there was little to gain and much to lose by doing so.

As the train pulled into the center of Ratz, she realized she had arrived at her destination. With a clear mind, she stepped off the train, feeling much more at ease. Suddenly, she heard her name being called.

“Susan!” Looking up, she saw her sister standing at the nearby bus stop, and a wide smile spread across her face.



"Seems like I was needlessly concerned. Captain Klauswitz's party went off without a hitch." 

Countess Trier smiled at Odette. The breathtaking coastal landscape of Ardene may have been the star of the show, but it was Odette, the hostess of the grand mansion, who added the perfect touch of elegance and sophistication. 

Every detail of the luncheon, from the exquisitely arranged table that blended in with the sea-facing garden to the seasonal menu that tantalized the taste buds of the guests, and even the seating plan that took into account the social status and bonds between them, was executed flawlessly. Truly, it was an exquisitely beautiful affair.

"You've transformed into a whole different person in just one season. You're a fine lady, I suppose it's not too much to say." Countess Trier exclaimed. The cries of seagulls flying low over the water mixed with the compliment. "I imagine you've already forgotten how I used to call the Countess every day and bug her since I didn't know anything," she said. 

Odette smiled softly as she regarded the sandy shore. As the warm sun beat down on the beach, the guests scattered in different directions to enjoy the afternoon activities. 

The adventurous ones headed out to sea on sleek yachts, slicing through the waves with the wind in their hair. Others opted to lounge on the sandy shores, soaking up the sun's rays and dipping their toes in the refreshing water. For those looking for a bit of exercise, a stroll along the beach offered stunning views of the sparkling ocean and towering cliffs in the distance. It was a perfect afternoon of leisure and excitement for all.

Countess Trier lauded Odette's achievement with just a few words of advice, hailing it as a talent deserving of praise. She emphasized that one couldn't fabricate or hide their bloodline, and that Odette's innate abilities were proof of her royal heritage. In a confident tone, she expressed her belief that if lineage was the sole determining factor, then surely Odette should have inherited more from her father.

With a disillusioned question on her mind, Odette chose to respect the grateful old lady's wishes by refraining from contradicting her. She didn't want to spoil such a beautiful day by bringing up her father. Additionally, there was a significant reason why she wasn't prepared to contemplate her father yet - she had forsaken him for Tira.

Even though Odette didn't look back on the decision she made that day, she couldn't shake the remorse and debt she carried in her heart. Perhaps she would have to live the rest of her life carrying a debt from her heart. It was the agony of Odette.

Countess Trier let out a disapproving click of her tongue and set down her half-empty champagne glass, urging Odette to leave the table of mostly elderly guests sitting under the white awning. She believed it was a waste of time for a young lady as lovely as Odette to engage in conversations with such dull and uninteresting people.

As Maxime and Odette strolled through the garden, Maxime deeply noticed the impressive landscaping. After taking a moment to admire it, he glanced over at Odette and brought up a fitting topic of conversation.

"It's really lovely here," Maxime commented. "The attention to detail is impressive."

"Yes, it's all thanks to Lord Xanders' advice. I know it's getting late, but I still want to thank you again for all of your help. Thank you for the recommendation." Odette said gratefully.

Maxime shook his head modestly. "You're welcome, but I must give credit where credit is due. Mrs. Klauswitz actually found the right answer."

As if that were the way things always happened. She resembled a queen who had led a magnificent life all of her life.

Bastian had a fondness for the coronation he had purchased with his own funds. He believed that if the world hadn't bestowed it upon him, he would have found a way to acquire it himself. There was something alluring about wearing a sparkling crown and ruling from a magnificent golden throne, no matter the cost.

"Bastian," Odette's voice interrupted his thoughts.

As Bastian searched for Odette among the crowd, he became increasingly perplexed by her absence. However, just as he was beginning to worry, he heard a familiar voice.

Despite the awkwardness of the situation, the child continued to sob, calling out to Odette as "mom" repeatedly and with increasing desperation. Her cries were so loud and piercing that they echoed across the sandy beach

"She's been missing her mother terribly," the Countess spoke up, deftly diffusing the awkward tension that had settled over the group.

"Yes, she's envious of the other children who have mothers.” Another woman, who had been observing the scene with growing unease, added her own comment. “Alma has taken a liking to Odette, you see."

Meanwhile, Maxime carried his inconsolable daughter away from the scene. As they retreated to the other side of the sandy beach, Alma continued to twist her neck and cry out for Odette.

"Please forgive me, Captain Klauswitz," Maxime apologized, feeling the weight of the situation on his shoulders. "It was just a child's mistake."

“Yes. It’s all right.”  It was a rather unpleasant situation, but fortunately Bastian gave a cool smile. “Sometimes kids get the wrong idea, Maxime’s late wife resembles my wife a lot.”

Just as the situation was finally resolved, Admiral Demel emerged from somewhere. Countess Trier's eyes narrowed as she shot him a glare. Her head started pounding again when she saw his carefree expression, as if he was completely unaware of the impact of his words.

"Isn't it true?” Admiral Demel continued to speak, despite the tense atmosphere, “They may have different heights, but their resemblance is striking. It's no wonder Alma mistook Odette for her mother." He laughed loudly, seemingly pleased with himself for contributing to the conversation. "And speaking of resemblance, Alma looks just like her mother. Yes, that's it. So, in a way, Odette and Alma do look like mother and daughter..."

"Please, have a taste of this." The Marchioness Demel hurriedly presented a plate of cake, leaving the Admiral bewildered. Despite the unexpected gesture, he took the plate from her and obediently sampled the cake.

Finally, Countess Trier let out a sigh of relief. The military man, whose common sense had obviously been submerged in the imperial sea, was now calmly devouring the fruitcake.

"When are you two going to start a family?"  Countess Trier playfully remarked. Bastian shifted his gaze from Maxime and his daughter, and Odette's cheeks flushed slightly. "You adore children so much, Odette. Imagine the love you'll have for your own."

Odette was presented with a cleverly laid-out subject, but for some reason, she hesitated to respond. Was it due to shyness? Countess Trier began to feel perplexed when unexpectedly, a bystander came to their aid. It was the antique dealer's grandson, who had been observing the situation.

Bastian gave Odette's back a gentle stroke, "I have no doubt that Odette will be an amazing mother, full of love for her children." He then placed a firm grip on her shoulders and continued, "I hope to have a daughter who takes after her mother. Do you not feel the same, my love?" 

The Count's daughter's tears finally ceased, and a white butterfly fluttered into the awning where the commotion had taken place, lazily exploring the surroundings.

Odette replied calmly after moistening her lips with cold water, "I don't believe it would make any difference." Despite her still-tense posture, her smile was flawlessly smooth and graced her glossy red lips.

As the Klauswitz couple's first child became the topic of discussion among the guests, opinions were tossed back and forth. Some suggested it would be a son, while others insisted it would be a daughter. The debate continued as to which parent the child should resemble. Despite the heated conversation, Bastian remained fixed on Odette, his gaze never leaving her.

A child.

It was a concept that had never truly crossed his mind. If he had to assign it some significance, it was merely an additional factor that came with the decision to marry. If he was fortunate, he would have a worthy successor, but if not, it didn't concern him much. His focus was solely on attaining his objective, and passing on his heritage held no appeal for him.

Bastian knew that the idea of having a child with Odette was off-limits, as it could cause problems in their relationship. He had learned from his father's mistakes and knew the importance of avoiding discord. 

Sandrine, on the other hand, was the woman he felt was deserving of bearing his child if he ever decided to have one. The thought of a child being born from Odette's body was something he had long dismissed.

Maxime, who had given his crying child to the nanny, apologized again, "Alma made a big mistake. I am sorry, Captain Klauswitz, and Mrs. Klauswitz." Bastian smiled at him and reassured him, "It's all right, Lord Xanders. I understand." He knew that this was the response everyone was hoping for.



The serene ambiance of the night sea was suddenly disrupted by an earth-shattering roar that could not be ignored.

 Intrigued by the commotion, Jeff Klauswitz made his way to the bedroom balcony, determined to uncover the source of the tumult. As he gazed out, a breathtaking spectacle unfolded before his eyes - a dazzling fireworks show that illuminated the grand mansion standing majestically across the bay. It appeared as though the raucous revelry was drawing to a close.

"Why are you hooked on that?" A voice full of anxiety asked from behind. Theodora had just entered the room, and she fixed her curious look on the person speaking.

As Jeff Klauswitz gave a cheerful response, his eyes remained transfixed on the night sky, captivated by the fireworks display. "Somehow, I felt compelled to have a closer look,"

 With a heavy sigh, Theodora joined him on the balcony, standing by his side. "He must be feeling ecstatic at the moment. It probably feels like he's firing shells right at us," 

"I would prefer that."

 "What do you mean by that?"  Theodora asked.

"Dealing with someone who has emotions would be a simpler task." Jeff chuckled cynically and approached the railing, taking a step closer.

Realizing the situation could escalate, he decided to intervene before things got out of hand. He had to put a stop to it before the situation spiraled any further.

Ever since Bastian bared his claws, Jeff had been racking his brains to find a way to fortify himself. However, the deeper he delved into the inner workings of Bastian's schemes, the more despondent his gaze became. A sense of inadequacy and helplessness overwhelmed him, as he contemplated the overwhelming outcomes that seemed inevitable.

He had been following Bastian's lead based on the hard-earned facts, but it didn't seem as easy for him to change the course of events as he had assumed. He may have to continue to live in this way for a while.

"I meant, Theodora, that if Bastian was bent on vengeance, he would target me. However, I never imagined it would be in this manner," Jeff explained, shaking his head in disbelief. As he did so, a sudden burst of fury surged within him.

It was clear that Bastian had no interest in their possessions. His temperament already showed that he would assault with the determination to destroy everything.

As he became aware of Bastian's sinister designs, a twinge of regret crept into Jeff Klauswitz's consciousness. He couldn't help but wonder if abandoning his child would have been the better choice.

With each passing moment, the remorse within him grew more profound, particularly when he considered the fragility of little Franz.

"Bastian is your son. Don't do this, please. Huh?"

As he spoke, memories of Sophia kneeling with her pregnant belly and offering prayers emerged, overshadowing the beautiful fireworks that adorned the night sky.

Taking care of the child he had fathered was the right thing to do, Jeff acknowledged. He had no intention of causing harm to Sophia, despite their complicated past.

In order to safeguard his family from financial ruin, Jeff had wed the daughter of a moneylender. The Klauswitz family was in dire need of Illis' financial resources at that time. Yet, despite the pragmatic reasons behind their union, Jeff had grown to genuinely love his wife. She was a gentle and stunningly beautiful woman who cherished him deeply. How could any man resist such a woman?

Jeff Klauswitz had once entertained the idea of spending his entire life with Sophia. If he had never crossed paths with Theodora, perhaps that fantasy would have become reality. If only Sophia had agreed to a divorce, she might still be alive today.

 The memory of his deceased wife, with their unborn child inside her, made him feel nauseous. The putrid stench of her blood and amniotic fluid seemed to linger in his nostrils, haunting him.

With blood and amniotic fluid surrounding him, the newborn Bastian did not cry. Instead, he stared at Jeff Klauswitz with an unsettling calmness from behind a partially open door.

 Jeff couldn't shake the feeling of disgust at the child's appearance, which seemed more like that of an adult than a newborn. Theodora claimed that Bastian was not a normal child, and this encounter only reinforced Jeff's unease.

He was initially hesitant, but eventually came to accept it. After all, Franz was born as the perfect son, receiving the noble blood of his mother. To ensure that Franz would be the rightful heir, Bastian had to be deemed abnormal.

"Don't be weak. In times like these,” Theodora's frown deepened as she firmly grasped Jeff's hand, “ you must steel yourself."

“I am aware, dear.” Jeff Klauswitz acknowledged Theodora's statement with a nod, accepting that there was no way to undo the past. He was left with only one option, to demonstrate that his choices were justifiable. As he attempted to clear his thoughts and turn around, a knock interrupted him.

"Excuse me, ma'am. I am Susan," spoke the maid who had gone on a vacation earlier this morning, deduced Jeff as he heard the knock on the door.



The night sky was illuminated with a grand display of vibrant fireworks, a spectacle of lights that was only reserved for official events. With awe and excitement in her eyes, Odette watched as the bursts of colors painted the sky, creating a surreal atmosphere.

 The fireworks seemed to bloom even in the sea, reflecting the stunning display in the waters below. It was a breathtaking sight that was almost too beautiful to believe.

As the last firework exploded in a burst of colors, she wondered if the party could be considered a success. She sensed Bastian's approach and felt a surge of cautious anticipation. 

The two stood together at the end of the terrace, fingers tightly intertwined, watching the display of lights in the sky. It felt natural for Bastian to hold her hand, and they both seemed lost in the beauty of the moment.

Bastian's side profile caught her attention as she slowly moved her head. She didn't want to sound patronizing. As Mrs. Klauswitz for the life of the contract, it was her responsibility to perform successfully. She was doing what she was meant to do, but it made her feel uncomfortable, which was sort of amusing.

The palms were firmly pushed together as the heat spread between them. She tried her hardest in memory of the days spent preparing for today.

As her emotions stirred like a burst of fireworks, Bastian's gaze slowly turned towards her. The way he looked at Odette was calm yet gentle, like a cool breeze on a summer night that signaled the arrival of autumn.

"How is everything going?" Bastian asked. The final firework burst in the sky, leaving Odette puzzled and confused by his cryptic question. "I believe my wife's infidelity is more than enough reason for the divorce you were concerned about," he continued, implying that he suspected Odette was having an affair with Maxime

The Ardene Bay was bathed in a cascade of golden fireworks, its brilliance illuminating the night sky. And yet, despite the beauty of the scene, Bastian's words pierced her heart like a knife. With a gentle voice, as if whispering sweet nothings, he shattered her illusions of love.

It was a cruel realization, but one that she could not deny.


Chapter 55.
Habits.



The first rays of the morning sun peeked through the window, casting a warm glow over the room. Bastian stirred awake and sat up, taking in the peaceful atmosphere of the early morning. 

He glanced over at Odette, still lost in her dreams. Her nightgown had slipped down, exposing the delicate curve of her neck.

His eyes travelled down her long, delicate neck and straight collarbone before stopping on her calmly rising and falling chest. It was obscured by the tilted blanket and nightgown, but it wasn't hard to guess what was underneath.

Bastian turned away from Odette and quickly got out of bed. The scene in the play where they summon a maid to witness their passionate exchange was left out. Due to the fact that the break was finished. The moment has come to head back to the Admiralty.

Bastian retraced his steps to his bedroom via the adjoining passage. As he stepped into the bathroom and turned on the shower, the first light of dawn was barely visible in the sky.

After satisfying his moderate desire, he finished his shower. It was a routine activity that required no conscious effort or willpower, similar to shaving, brushing hair, or putting on a uniform.

“Do you really want such a scandal?”

Odette's measured question entered his head just as he was about to press the final button on his jacket.

Odette didn't start speaking until the fireworks display was over; she had been gazing at Bastian in silence for a while. Even the slightest hint of perplexity was gone, leaving only peace on her face. He gave a head nod in understanding.

A naive yearning to discover the noble woman's actual emotions or a cheap curiosity about her profundity. It was a horrible feeling, either way.

"Fine. If that's your desire." 

Odette's acquiescence was laced with disdain as she replied. Her response to Bastian's earlier proposal was equally blunt,

 "I'll find a suitable partner when the time comes." 

Bastian chuckled dryly as he finished fastening his last button. She didn't even know how to kiss properly, so how could she imitate a promiscuous woman?

Even if it wasn't in the same vein, it was difficult to write it off as foolishness.

With a single glance, Odette could attract enough scandalous men to fill her ten fingers, if she so desired. She had no need for any seductive tactics, as her natural allure was enough.

Bastian finished preparing for the day, adjusting the shape of his shoulder straps, before opening his eyes. As he did, the butler entered the room with a cup of hot, strong coffee.

"Considering your long commute to work, it must be difficult for you. Therefore, I have arranged for Hans to assist you," offered Butler Lovis.

Bastian shrugged indifferently and added a handful of sugar to his cup of coffee. It was his usual breakfast routine.

"Please do have a proper meal at least. I would hate for you to harm yourself." Lovis persisted.

Bastian set down his empty cup and reached for his hat. "Thank you, Lovis, but I know my own body. There's no need to worry."

Lovis furrowed his brow. "It's hard to believe you'd say that, considering someone in your position who has had to delay their duties due to health problems."

"I suppose a hearty breakfast will protect me from enemy fire?" 

Bastian  made light of the situation, and Lovis could sense the clear boundary he drew. With a heavy sigh, Lovis retreated, and they both knew this was an unspoken understanding that had developed over their years of working together.

Bastian glanced at the clock and strode swiftly out the bedroom. The entry hall of the mansion, which was lined with servants who had come out to see him leave, came into view after travelling through the lengthy corridor and down the central staircase.

In the center, Odette was holding out for him. The hostess' elegant body gained sophistication from the early sunlight streaming in through the big window on the landing. It was difficult to imagine that she had once been a lady who had slept unsecured and unattended.

As he got closer to his wife, Bastian scowled a little. Next, a polite cheek kiss was given, to which Odette reciprocated with a smile. Acting was sufficient to live up to the expectations of those around them.

Bastian’s hand gently brushed the corners of Odette's red eyes. “You don't have to come out tomorrow. There's no need for you to wake up early and go through this kind of formality,” he said in a soft whisper."

“No. As I am unable to sleep in when it is morning, it is not difficult. It is nothing in comparison to the delight of seeing you again." 

Odette's face was showing signs of nervousness, but she kept up her believable behavior. She might be able to obtain a main role at the Royal Theatre by the time of their divorce, given how her abilities were growing every day.

Bastian made the decision to change the subject when he saw Odette's hardened eyes. A lot of eyeballs were everywhere to watch. There was no need to make an effort to instigate pointless conflicts and stir up distrust.

“If there is anything you need, let me know."

Bastian effortlessly arrived at the best answer. He was fairly certain of the type of response that would be given. Odette also stayed inside the planned range.

"You are everything I need." With a countenance that was barely changed from when she said the crazy thing about finding an affair partner if he did, Odette mumbled a lovely fib. Bastian desired a controversy to serve as the catalyst for.

Bastian gave his wonderful wife another kiss as a praise. Her forehead and flushed cheeks were touched by his lips.

Slowly, he moved his lips. Odette jerked her body in surprise, but he moved a little quicker as he securely enveloped her face.

When Lovis's coughing announced the time of departure, which could no longer be delayed, the slow and persistent parting kiss came to an end.

Odette strained to control her breath as Bastian lightly kissed her lips before letting go. Her breath, which came out in a tiny sigh, was sticky with heat. The conclusion was gratifying.

"Let's eat dinner together, please. I'll be back as soon as eight at the latest."  With that pledge, Bastian exited the mansion.

“Bastian!” 

He opened the driver's door just as he heard Odette's urgent call. Bastian observed her from behind him.

"It's not necessary to go over. Although I would like to be there with you, I don't want to be a burden."

Once more, his devoted wife displayed endearing sympathy.

"Don't stress over that. Today is not a hectic day. "With a reaction fit for a husband who cares and loves his wife, Bastian wrapped up the programme.

With a glance at his watch, Bastian swiftly slid into the driver's seat of his car. Although the time was later than anticipated, he aimed to make up for lost time by accelerating as much as he could. 

As he started the car, the line of servants standing in front of the mansion bowed in unison. Bastian returned the gesture with a nod and focused his attention on the center of the crowd. There, standing tall and straight, was Odette, illuminated by the brilliant sunlight.

As Bastian left the estate and stepped on the accelerator, the view behind him quickly disappeared. The fog that had once enveloped the horizon vanished, revealing a bright and clear day with a sea of bright blue-green. 

As he drove along the winding coastal road, his gaze kept returning to the ocean, almost involuntarily, as if his body had a mind of its own.



A puppy with a shaggy coat and a dusty coat suddenly appeared in the woods. 

Odette quickly pulled back on the horse's reins to stop it as she carefully navigated the road. Luckily, the devoted horse obeyed her urgent order instantly, allowing her to quickly dismount. Odette approached the hairy creature, which was standing in the center of the road and waving its tail as if to say hello, her heart pounding.

"I'm curious where you're from. Do you still have your owner?" Odette approached the puppy with caution, asking it a number of questions while sounding worried. The dog began to hop up and down with joy as its eagerness increased. Odette moved closer to the dog when another dog appeared from the surrounding grass.

She was startled and came to a complete stop. Though being dressed in a sloppy, dust- and dirt-covered attire, the dog appeared to be of a good breed. It had long, white fur that reached the ground that was soft and big. A wandering dog could never have given off that look.

"Oh, you are the mother." 

Odette unintentionally let out a long sigh as she stared at the stray dog with the bulging milk. Yet making a casual approach proved challenging. The mother growled ferociously while obstructing the baby's path and bared its teeth.

The suspicious dog didn't relax and kept its guard up despite Odette's soothing gestures and attempts to convey her pleasant intentions. Odette took a couple steps backwards carefully to give the dog some room. She was left wondering where such a strange dog could have come from as the mother dog and her pup disappeared into the woods. 

Odette was trying to figure out what was going on as she stared into the thick woodland where the dogs had disappeared. As far as the eye could see, there were only two mansions in the area, both belonging to the wealthy Klauswitz families. 

Odette and Bastian's mansion was virtually dog-free, so the only possible explanation for the barking that had roused them from their slumber was the family home across the forest, looming ominously in the distance. 

But there was a glimmer of hope: perhaps they could reach out to their neighbors and inquire if they had lost a dog. After all, the two mansions were in close enough proximity to each other that communication was possible.

It had been at least two months since the mother had given birth in the seclusion of the woods, based on the size of the puppy. They most certainly wouldn't have gone that long without communication if the dog's owner had lost track of it. She was forced to ask herself the same question she had been considering from the beginning after coming to this conclusion.

With a heavy sigh, Odette turned around, her heart sinking as she realized that time was running out. There was less than half an hour left for her to indulge in her passion for horseback riding before she was expected to welcome the esteemed guests. If she failed to make a swift exit, she would have to face them in her riding clothes - an unforgivable faux pas that would undoubtedly draw the cold contempt of her husband, Bastian.

The weight of his intense gaze often left her feeling burdened and despondent, a misery she hoped never to endure again. To shake off the overwhelming emotions, she cleared her mind of all extraneous thoughts and feelings before mounting her horse once more.

 Fortunately, with her new riding clothes having arrived just the previous weekend, she was able to clamber onto the horse with greater ease than before.

Odette was grateful for the kind consideration that Bastian had shown her. He had gifted her a magnificent horse that she could ride to her heart's content, along with all the necessary equipment to make the experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. 

Even though she was always conscious of the public eye and the expectations that came with her position, she never took for granted the immense value of the favors bestowed upon her by Bastian.

Despite the pain of his heart-wrenching words, Odette stayed determined to perform to the best of her abilities. 

She gritted her teeth and soldiered on, playing the role of the loving newlywed even as it became more and more challenging with each passing day. Her ultimate goal was to leave a lasting impression on her husband as an employee who had earned every penny of her high salary.

Bastian had suspicions she would eventually have an affair and seek a divorce, yet Odette had other plans in her mind. Once her contract was up, she intended to retreat from the public eye and live a quiet life away from the influence of the royal family and their social circles. 

For now, all she could hope for was to part with Bastian on good terms and bring their complicated relationship to a positive conclusion.

Odette moved her horse in the direction of a shortcut after taking her eyes off the route where the two dogs had vanished. Horse hooves soon started making a loud echoing sound along the overgrown trail.


Chapter 56.
The Light That Waited for Him.



"You know, my father used to work as a blacksmith," As Molly chatted away non-stop, she eventually began to share the story of her family.  "Unfortunately, he was seriously injured in an accident and has been unwell for quite some time now."

Odette glanced at the mirror in front of the dressing table and caught sight of Molly combing her hair. When their eyes met, Molly's shy smile struck a chord with Odette. The young girl's chatty and bubbly personality was just like her younger sister Tira’s. It occurred to Odette that they were probably around the same age.

Mesmerized by the similarities between Molly and her sister, Odette curled her lips into a gentle smile, signaling that she was ready to listen to whatever the young maid had to say.

Molly's eyes sparkled with joy as she delved deeper into her family's history, her voice filled with even more enthusiasm. She spoke mostly about her father, who had been left paralyzed by a tragic accident. It was evident that Molly shared a unique and special bond with him, which made her story all the more heartfelt.

"Madam, I'm sure you must be worried about your father on his sickbed too, right?" As the hair brushing neared its end, Molly posed a bold question to Odette.

"Molly!" Dora's sharp shout interrupted as she worked on Odette's dress, but Molly wasn't easily deterred.

"You haven't been able to visit your father in the hospital since your marriage. How Madam’s heart is must ache," she said, looking at Odette with teary eyes through the mirror.

Odette's heart felt like it was being clawed by a nightmare at the sound of the name "Father", but she hid it behind a composed expression. Instead, she patiently waited for Molly to finish her work, a gentle smile gracing her lips. It was the least she could do for the young maid, who had made a mistake but deserved compassion.

People need to be spaced apart in a reasonable manner. It served as a kind of buffer, guarding against interactions that were based only on position or rank. Because of how that divide contributes to understanding and respect.

"My apologies, madam.” Dora, who had almost shown Molly the door, expressed regret, “Despite her intelligence and competence, it seems that Molly still has room for improvement in terms of etiquette and has made a significant error."

"No worries. She only meant well." With a chuckle, Odette quelled the minor disturbance, assuring everyone

 The clever head maid promptly resumed her tasks, making no further fuss about the incident.

Odette set up her dresser the way she always did as Dora finished the dress. She was able to move through her nightly routine at a more leisurely pace than normal because the man who had been giving her disturbing stares was obviously not around.

"It's likely that the master is lodging at Mr. Mueller's place, so you should get some rest, madam." Dora appeared from behind the dressing table and suggested.

Odette set aside the comb she had been absently playing with and rose from her seat, as if complying to Dora's advice.

Last week, the guy was a model employee - clocking out on time every day to make it home in time for dinner. However, today he had to work late due to some pressing business. Though he hadn't explicitly mentioned it, Dora had a sneaking suspicion that he might not come back home that night, and as the clock neared midnight, her intuition seemed spot on.

The man had a grueling journey ahead of him, and even if he managed to catch some shut-eye, he'd have to be up at the crack of dawn to head back to work.

As Dora was about to leave after briefing Odette about the schedule for the following day, she unexpectedly interjected, "Excuse me, but Mr. Lovis mentioned he had a favor to ask of you. Can I plead his case?"

Odette perched herself on the edge of the bed and turned to face Dora. "Sure, what does he need?"

"He's fretting about the master's breakfast habits," Dora revealed. "To be honest, I share his concerns."

Odette looked puzzled. "Let me get this straight - Mr. Lovis is worried about Bastian's breakfast?"

Bastian Klauswitz was a strapping, affluent young man who had gained fame as a valiant soldier, lauded for his bravery. Odette couldn't fathom why anyone would fret over the eating habits of someone who was already in such excellent shape.

"Yes, madam," Dora replied. "I've been suggesting to the master that he starts his day with a hearty meal instead of just a cup of strong coffee, but he doesn't seem to heed my advice. We were hoping that you could intervene on our behalf and convince him to listen to your wise words since he values your opinion greatly."

 "Uh, sure, I'll try my best," Odette let out an awkward chuckle. She knew that if the stubborn master wouldn't listen to the wise counsel of his trusted butler, there was little chance that he'd take heed of his pretend wife's nagging. But she still agreed to give it a shot.

No matter what she considered, the request was absurd, but Odette first consented. She would just tell him the truth and seek for his help if things got too rough. He never shied away from portraying a perfect relationship, though.

"I'm grateful, ma'am. The master needs you by his side because he doesn't take care of himself very well. " Dora lowered her head in sincere joy. Odette had never seen a face as dazzling as hers.

As soon as Dora left, the bedroom fell into a deeper silence.

Odette moved to the window, wrapped in a warm shawl, and gently pushed back the drapes to reveal the wide expanse of the nighttime, moonless sea. 

The sound of the waves, which had been a comforting relief all summer as she stared out at the desolate waters, appeared to have a hint of sorrow. She questioned whether the beginning of a new season was what had caused this shift.

As the curtains were drawn shut, the reality dawned on Odette that he wouldn't be returning tonight. With a heavy heart, she concluded her daily routine and retreated to bed. But as she switched off the lights and snuggled under the covers, memories of her estranged father came crashing in like a tumultuous wave. 

She knew that eventually, she would have to confront the painful past and pay him a visit. With a deep, melancholic sigh, she clutched her blanket tightly, aware that her despondency would be conspicuous even to the young maid.

Speculation swirled in Odette's mind, leaving her with little confidence to confront her father with composure. Yet she knew that turning a blind eye to him was not a sustainable solution. 

With a heavy heart, she made a vow to write a letter to him the following day, determined to face her demons head-on. As she shut her eyes, she was aware of the bed's emptiness and the cold seeping in, signaling the need to stoke the dying embers of the fire.



As midnight crept closer, the carriages and automobiles that had been queued up in front of Sergeant Illis' building began to vanish, one by one. With only two cars left, Bastian bid farewell to his colleagues and made his exit.

"Join me today," Thomas Mueller gestured towards his car. It was already too late for Bastian to drive back to Ardene, but he declined Thomas' offer without much thought.

Bastian shook his head, "No, I'll head home," 

"It's a long drive back to Ratz, and you won't get much sleep before you have to come back.” Thomas Mueller tried to dissuade Bastian from leaving so late, “ Is it really worth pushing yourself?"

"Well, you know how it is. Gotta keep the new wife happy." 

Thomas smiled awkwardly, unsure of how to respond, "The age-old myth that even heroes can be swayed by the charms of a beautiful woman appears to hold true," Thomas conceded, unable to persuade Bastian any further. "I must admit, I had my fears about the young master marrying the wrong woman and living an unhappy life."

"Don't worry, Sir. Odette is a good person," reassured Bastian.

"Sure, you have my full trust because you say so," Thomas Mueller grinned broadly. Despite the fact that the fatigue from the hard effort was evident, Bastian's face appeared at relaxed. If marriage was the cause of this transformation, Mrs. Klauswitz was a bride who brought a sizable dowry.

"Hey, Young master!" Thomas Mueller couldn't help but shout out as he watched Bastian walking away.

Bastian paused and slowly turned around on the last remaining step.

The word hung in the air like a heavy cloud, shrouding the two men in silence. Thomas could see the ease with which Bastian interacted with Odette, and his heart softened. He wanted Bastian to forget about his revenge, and that's why he made the impulsive call. 

Bastian understood Thomas's intention, but he knew he couldn't let go of his past so easily. With a heavy heart, he uttered a single, dejected word - "No." 

The silence continued for a while longer until Bastian finally broke it with a smile and a bow, before disappearing into the darkness, stepping into a sleek black car waiting for him under a canopy of trees.

The car accelerated swiftly and sped off to the opposite side of the city. Even the last of the elderly woman's pride was destroyed by the landscape.



“Madam had gone to bed”

The butler greeted Bastian with the news to which Bastian responded with a smile and proceeded to cross the entrance hall, not feeling the need to say anything. He knew that it was highly unlikely for Odette to be awake at such a late hour, and the thought of her being up would have only caused him unease.

Bastian acknowledged the servants for their tireless efforts throughout the night and proceeded to his chamber with a serene gait. As he stepped into his room, he realized he wouldn't have to share his bed tonight, a fact that brought a sense of relief. It was at this very moment that the mansion's lights began to shimmer against the shoreline, painting a picturesque view.

As Bastian emerged from the bedroom, his mind still fixated on his decision. He had freshened up and changed, but his resolve remained unshaken. 

He had no intention of disturbing Odette's peaceful slumber; the performance he had put on earlier was enough. But as he stood at the threshold between the two rooms, the absurdity of the situation dawned on him with a jolt. It was almost comical, this image of a man hesitating to enter his own bedroom.

Bastian was a firm believer in the power of routine. It was a way to conserve mental energy and emotions, and the most effective method for living life. However, his conviction was faltering now. He acknowledged the chance of being wrong and hesitated before placing his hand on the doorknob.

Odette had gradually assimilated into his daily routine, but far of making his life simpler, it had made it more complicated. Bastian hesitated as he approached the last door because he knew what was there would only make things more difficult.

For a moment, he watched Odette sleeping peacefully, then returned to his own room. But he quickly realized that there was no reason to have hesitated in the first place.

He was entitled to exercise all of his desired authority. Odette was required to comply and follow. As it was stated in their contract. Her opinions were not taken into account; only his requirements were important.

His thoughts vanished when he consciously reminded himself of that reality.

Bastian moved forward with a purposeful stride, driven by his own requirements. He pushed open the door and made his way through the comfortable space till he came to Odette's bed. His imagination suddenly solidified a fresh demand. On the nightstand to the right of the bed, a lamp illuminated with a glow. 

Bastian's gaze remained fixed on the last remaining light in the room, transfixed by its glow, even as the droplets of water on his wet hair dripped down and re-formed.

 As the grandfather clock chimed the hour, he heard a faint sigh, and his attention turned to the sleeping figure on the bed. He swallowed hard and averted his gaze, but it was too late. In the soft light, Odette stirred and slowly opened her eyes, fixing them on him.

“Bastian”

Odette called him, as soon as her deep sleep got invaded by his arrival.

"You're back,"

She sound like a devoted wife. 


Chapter 57.
 A True Lie.



The prospect of winning seemed rather bleak, but undaunted, Odette gathered her resolve and initiated her daily routine with a composed tap on the door.

"Please enter," Bastian's voice droned from behind the closed door.

Odette didn't hesitate any longer, unlocked the door, and went into Bastian's bedroom despite the fact that she was still carrying a weight that she couldn't seem to get rid of. Soon after, the butler and an attendant carrying a tray with a basic breakfast arrived.

“Odette.” 

Out of the blue, Bastian swiveled around and uttered her name, catching her off guard. Odette had been staring at her balled-up hands and halted her steps involuntarily.

Midway through his outfit transition, Bastian found himself caught off guard. The only attire adorning his figure was a pristine, buttoned-up shirt, while his undergarments and socks lay in plain sight. Taken aback by the unexpected sight, Odette quickly averted her gaze, wishing she had picked a better moment to approach. However, having already made her presence known, she found herself unable to make a graceful exit.

Odette struggled to force her lips open but managed to do so and hurried to the table. The butler moved aside to make room for the maid who was waiting for her turn after placing a kettle of water and coffee on the table. In accordance with her instructions, the spread in front of her included boiled eggs, simple bread, and a variety of grilled fruits and vegetables.

After carefully arranging the cutlery and napkins, Odette took her seat at the table, determined to put on a façade of composure, despite her inner turmoil.

"What is it, madam," Bastian asked, his voice laced with amusement.

“It’s breakfast, as you can as well, see." Odette announced, having steeled herself for the confrontation. She turned her head to face Bastian, only to be greeted by the awkward spectacle of him fastening the hem of his shirt to his thigh garter buckle.

Though flustered by the embarrassing sight, Odette found it difficult to avert her gaze, as there seemed to be no other suitable place to look.

Bastian methodically rolled up his sleeve, adorning his wrist with a gleaming timepiece and a pair of cufflinks. Next in line was his tie, which he tied with practiced ease. Only then did he attend to the long-awaited task of donning his pants.

Meanwhile, the butler tended to Bastian's well-polished footwear, ensuring that they were pristine and free of any blemish.

A deep sigh escaped Odette's lips as she took a proper glance at her husband, Bastian. While he checked the time, he moved towards the mirror to adjust his tie and shirt collar with a practiced hand.

She observed him with a mix of curiosity and wariness, as it was the first time she had seen a man getting ready for the day. She noted the stark contrast in their approaches to dressing up, with men's rituals being markedly different from those of women. The way they handled even the simplest of tasks, such as straightening a collar, seemed to be infused with a certain masculinity that was foreign to her.

Bastian employed harsh lines to draw attention to his body's structure as opposed to her, who concentrated on sculpting the softest curves and wrinkles. He appeared to be smooth and graceful due to this, despite his somewhat higher stature and frame.

Bastian slipped on his uniform jacket after one final inspection of his look. He had barely turned his back and the early morning light was falling on his shoulders. Odette had seen the cop before, and it had the same expression.

"You need not go through all this trouble, my dear Odette. A cup of coffee suffices for me," Bastian said as he made his way towards the table, coming to a halt in front of it. 

Bastian's response was anticipated,but Odette remained unfazed. "Considering the long commute to work, perhaps it's time to shake things up a bit?" 

She had a knack for persuading and nurturing adults, a skill she had honed thanks to her daughter Tira, who had a habit of expressing her concerns in a concise and poignant manner.

Although Tira was a very small and frail child at the time, the core issue remained essentially the same.

Odette flashed a warm, sisterly smile "Why don't we give eggs a try?" She chose to ignore Bastian's incredulous gaze, which seemed to question her sanity. "Did you know that by observing the way the shell cracks, I can predict your fortune for the day?" she added with a hint of playfulness.

Odette ignored Bastian's lack of response and carried on with her work. She started by replacing him with a cup holding a warm egg and a spoon for cracking the shell.

"Come on, Bastian. Let me read your fortune," she urged with a cheerful smile. The morning sun cast a radiant glow on her as she bustled about, tending to various tasks. Bastian surveyed the bustling breakfast table and the attentive butler before his gaze settled back on her.

"Please," Odette murmured softly, her eyes imploring. Even when expressing remorse, she remained steadfast and determined, her resolve etched onto her features.

Bastian regarded his beseeching wife with a stern countenance, as if she were a creditor demanding payment. Yet, he sat down across from Odette with a smile, giving away little of his inner thoughts. It was clear that the butler had enlisted Odette's help in coaxing his master to partake of breakfast, and the diligent woman had taken on the task with her characteristic determination, even if it meant spouting some nonsensical words in the early hours of the day.

The coffee, which was as tasteless as plain water, was the first thing Bastian sipped. There were no longer the sugar cubes that were normally arranged together. Lovis looked resolved to believe in the hostess’ power.

"I know you may not feel like eating right now, but it's important to have something more substantial than just coffee. I don't want it to harm your health." Odette spoke softly, concern etched on her face. 

Bastian sat across from her, his chin resting on his hand as he held the egg spoon. “Why? Do you worry about becoming a widow?" Tak, an eggshell breaking sound, then a light-hearted query.

“Yes. I don't want to be left all by myself. I wouldn't like a world without you."  Odette eventually smiled as she peered at Bastian's egg cup. In reality, she always told the truth when she lied, but the egg-fortune reading was really a ruse to catch Tira's attention, similar to how it is right now.

"After closely examining the egg like a curious scholar.” Odette declared, "It's a lucky star," She returned it to Bastian. "Seems like it's going to be a good day for you."  She then placed a plate of bread, vegetables, and fruits next to his egg cup with care. "Once you finish those eggs, your fortune will be granted," she said.

Odette's eyes shone with sincerity as she told the most ridiculous lie. Bastian looked at her quizzically but complied nonetheless, scooping up a spoonful of egg.

Seeing the expression of admiration on the old butler's face, Odette's sense of accomplishment was multiplied. It was her first task of the day and she had successfully completed it. It was also a morning of good luck for Odette, as a lucky star had appeared.



"Has he received any news from his daughter yet?" 

Theodora's eyes opened unexpectedly, and she posed the question. Her maid, who was in the middle of combing her hair, quickly looked up at her master's reflection in the mirror.

"Unfortunately, no. It's been said that he's waiting for his daughter like a corpse these days. But, the Duke's daughter is still nowhere to be seen," came the reply.

"What a pity," Theodora sighed, clicking her tongue in sympathy, before closing her eyes once more.

With a surprise in tow, Susan returned from her vacation, carrying with her the forgotten puzzle piece of Duke Dyssen. Despite being crippled from a fall, the Duke's past and possible significance to the world had been all but forgotten. But now, it seemed that his son-in-law and daughter were the cause of his unfortunate fate.

Susan's devotion to her sister did not go unnoticed by Theodora, who rewarded her with the opportunity to be her personal maid for a while. And, as a sign of gratitude, Theodora made sure to compensate Susan financially, twice the amount her sister received from Bastian for taking care of the Duke.

Although her husband disagreed, Theodora believed that being generous with money was essential to win people over. It was this belief that had helped her climb the social ladder.

"Convey this to your sister - she just needs to inform me of Duke Dyssen's whereabouts. There's no danger involved." Once her hair was fully brushed, Theodora stood up and picked up a pair of pearl earrings from her dressing table. Susan often admired them, and her eyes widened as Theodora handed them to her. Theodora believed that being generous with her wealth was a key to winning people's hearts and reaching her current status.

“Dear Madam, This is not required of you. Oh, my God. I won't dare take this priceless item."

"I understand your hesitation, Susan, but please don't refuse. We've been friends for so long," Theodora said, placing a hand on Susan's trembling one as she offered the pearl earrings.

Overwhelmed with gratitude, Susan couldn't help but tear up as she carefully wrapped the precious jewels and left.

Theodora let out a deep sigh, settled back onto the sofa, and reached for her cigarette. She was skeptical of what she had just heard, considering it to be mostly nonsense. Nevertheless, if there was something to gain from it, she could potentially hasten the day when she could live with her curtains wide open once again.

Theodora had a strong gut feeling about Bastian's wife, even though there was no concrete proof to support it. To ease her nerves, she lit up a few cigarettes and started her day by visiting her son's room.

Despite her repeated pleas for her son to treat his fiancée kindly, Theodora saw no significant improvement in his behavior towards her. The situation had gotten so bad that the Countess Klein had even called to express her daughter's distress over not having seen her fiancé in a while. 

While the Countess's request for the couple to have some social time together was made in jest, the underlying message was clear: if Theodora's son wanted a safe and successful wedding, he needed to treat his future bride with the respect and care she deserved.

Theodora's indomitable pride was dealt a blow, and she had to swallow it. It was nothing short of a miracle for the Klauswitz family, a noble house of lesser standing, to be accepted as in-laws by the esteemed Klein family. The engagement process was by no means an easy feat, and it wouldn't have been possible without the unyielding determination of Ella, who had wholeheartedly fallen for Franz.

"Franz." Theodora impatiently knocked on the door and called out her son's name.

 Despite receiving no report of his departure, there was no response from Franz even after waiting for a long time.

Theodora, used to this, pulled a key from her skirt pocket and unlocked the door. The room was empty save for its master, and the early sunlight poured in through the window.

‘Anyway, it doesn’t look like he’s up to speed.’ Theodora's brows wrinkled sharply as she gazed out the window at the countryside.

Theodora's gaze fell on the imposing mansion outside the window, a constant reminder of Bastian's defiance. Againts its prominence, Franz remained unfazed. It was no wonder her husband held a disapproving view of their son.

Theodora was just about to walk away when something caught her eye – an easel standing on the balcony outside the window. She gently touched her throbbing head before hurrying over to take a closer look. It was then that she realized why Franz had been neglecting his fiancée – he was engrossed in his art once more.

Theodora's resolve to reprimand her son for his negligence dissolved upon seeing the painting on the easel. An unfinished portrait of a stunning beauty, unmistakably Bastian's wife, Odette. With a quick chuckle, Theodora gazed out at the sea.


Chapter 58.
I Promise.


As Odette was preparing to take a stroll, she was interrupted by the news of a phone call from Tira, who resided at Gillis Girls' Academy's dormitory.

In haste, she concealed the bag of food she had prepared for the stray dogs and made her way to the study to answer the call.

[Hello, sister!]

With a deep breath, she lifted the receiver and heard Tira's joyful voice on the other end.

[Slow down, dear sister. You'll lose your breath]

Tira's words rushed out as she picked up the phone. 

"How's your first semester going at the new school? Are you doing well in class? And are you taking care of yourself?" Odette asked, her concern evident in her voice. Tira's playful laughter reminded Odette to calm down and enjoy the moment.

Tira's responses came in a cheerful stream, one after the other. She spoke of how the new school year had brought more fun, and how she had made many new friends with whom she shared her classes. 

Her teachers were excellent, and she was making great progress in her studies. Tira even proudly mentioned that she had added an inch to her waist, all thanks to her healthy appetite. Listening to her sister's positive report, Odette felt relieved and content.

As she sighed in relief, Tira unexpectedly shared,

 [Oh, sister, I had a dream about our father a few days ago.]

[Although it was only a dream, my father sending me to jail felt unbelievably re…]

“Stop Tira!” Odette halted Tira mid-sentence, sensing a deep-seated anxiety in her younger sister's voice. "Don't worry about it, Tira. I already told Father I would shoulder the burden," 

[But sister…]

“Listen up, Tira. If you say that one more time, I will never see you again.” Odette rechecked the tightly closed library door and scolded Tira coldly.

Tira's sullen voice broke the heavy silence as she spoke, [I'm sorry, sister. I like everything that's happening now, and that's why I was anxious. I've never been this happy before, but I was so afraid of losing it all.]

“It's all right, Tira.” Odette's voice, which had become warmer once more, calmed Tira. "I never will allow that to happen." She made a serious commitment to herself as well.

Tira let out a small laugh. [I'll truly forget about it now. Just promise me you won't say such frightening things again. You may have a new family now, sister, but you're still my sister. Without you, I'm all alone.]

"Okay, I promise," Odette replied with a soft sigh and a chuckle. "You know, Tira, you're actually my only family." Her unspoken thoughts about her fake family flooded her mind.

Tira's mood swings subsided quickly, and she regained her cheerfulness. She excitedly shared stories about learning to ride a bike with her friend, a kind boy from a neighboring boys' school, and the upcoming school festival next month. Hearing these refreshing and innocent tales from a schoolgirl's life, Odette's lingering worries dissipated.

[Sister, would you be able to come to the parent invitation day? Even though it's held during the festival, to me, you're like a mother.] 

As the phone call was coming to a close, Tira asked Odette a tentative question.

 [I don't want to trouble you. If you're busy, it's okay not to come. And you don't have to bring actual parents, they said.]

"I'll see if the schedule permits," Odette excused her tardiness in responding with a firm response.

Carlsbar was a distant city that demanded at least a two-day absence, regardless of how tight Odette's schedule was. Obtaining Bastian's permission was crucial, as it was a matter of proper protocol between employer and employee, as he had defined it.

[Okay, I'll talk to you next time. Love you, sis. Bye!] 

As Tira bid farewell with a cheery tone, it was apparent that she was crestfallen. However, before Odette could respond with a whisper of "I love you too," the phone line went dead.

With a firm grip on her emotions, Odette departed from the study, her face devoid of any personal sentiments. The day was beautiful, the sky clear and warm, and she was determined not to allow herself to be consumed by futile melancholy and ruin the pleasant day.

Let’s accept force majeure. Let’s not dwell on things that can’t be helped with your own strength. Let’s find what’s best for the situation and enjoy it. She knew it wouldn’t work out, but Odette still made that promise every morning.

Despite the worsening state of her life, there was one ritual that Odette clung to with unwavering devotion. It was a small, seemingly insignificant act, but it held immense power over her psyche. With each passing day, the pattern of her routine grew more intricate, like the threads of a tapestry that interwove to create a beautiful and intricate design.

"Madam, you have a visitor," the butler announced, his voice as crisp and polished as his uniform.

As Odette returned to her room, she was hit with yet another unwelcome surprise - her carefully stashed bag of food was missing. With a heavy sigh, she resigned herself to the fact that she would have to hide it again, this time under the bed. After hastily straightening her disheveled clothes, she braced herself and opened the bedroom door.

The unexpected arrival of a guest sent ripples of surprise through the otherwise tranquil household. Startled, Odette turned to the head maid for an explanation. "I didn't know we had any guests today," 

The head maid, ever poised and professional, held out a visiting card with practiced ease. "Yes, Madam," she replied, her voice as smooth as silk. "He claims to have no prior appointment, but requests a moment of your time."

Odette's gaze widened as she scanned the name of the unexpected visitor - Maxime von Xanders.



As Bastian idly gazed out the car window, his eyes happened to catch a familiar figure on the street corner. It was his father, Jeff Klauswitz, exiting a high-end jewelry store with a young woman who appeared to be no more than a few years older than Franz.

Despite the bustling energy of the downtown district and the frenetic pace of the rush hour traffic, Bastian felt his world slow down to a crawl. He watched in silent disbelief as his father and the unknown woman strolled away from the store, hand in hand, seemingly oblivious to the world around them.

It was a moment frozen in time, a surreal tableau that would forever be etched in Bastian's mind.

It being their first encounter, but the woman's appearance was eerily familiar to Bastian. With her platinum locks and piercing sky blue eyes, she exuded a delicate and innocent beauty - much like his deceased mother.

Bastian snorted in derision and turned away from the distasteful scene before him. He knew that his father's latest mistress would not last long - once she passed the age at which his mother had died, she would be swiftly replaced with another young and beautiful woman.

As he sat in the bar, surrounded by the flickering glow of neon lights and the raucous chatter of the patrons, he couldn't help but feel a pang of bitterness towards his stepmother. Her unwavering devotion to his father, and her desperate attempts to usurp Mrs. Klauswitz's position, were nothing but a sad parody of love - a far cry from the deep and meaningful connection that his mother had shared with her undeserving partner.

Yet, even in the face of such trifling matters, Bastian remained steadfast in his convictions. He would never let anyone forget the true magnitude of his mother's love - a love that transcended time, space, and even death itself.

With the traffic jam finally clearing up, Bastian revved his engine and left the city behind him in a blur of speed and adrenaline.

Meanwhile, back in the heart of Berg, the race to secure the rights for building a railway connecting the north and south was reaching a fever pitch. 

For weeks, it seemed that Jeff Klauswitz was the clear frontrunner - until a new challenger emerged from the shadows. It was a railway company that Bastian had founded in collaboration with LaViere - a formidable force that threatened to upend Klauswitz's plans and change the face of Berg forever.

As the news broke that Jeff Klauswitz had been denied the right to build the railroad, Bastian felt a surge of satisfaction - knowing that this setback would deal a major blow to his father's ambitions, and force him to go even deeper into the trap that Bastian had carefully set.

But Bastian knew that he couldn't rest on his laurels just yet. With Jeff now desperate to find a way out of this mess, he would undoubtedly make some rash and aggressive investments - all in the hopes of finding a breakthrough that could save his plans.

Thankfully, he had been preparing for this day for months - and he was ready for whatever his father might throw at him. As he sat back and waited for Jeff to take the bait, he felt a sense of quiet confidence - knowing that he had outsmarted his old man once again.

Bastian smoked his cigarette and accelerated as he crossed the boundary between Ratz and Ardene.

In actuality, the endeavor was not worthwhile. Because his father would destroy himself even if left alone.

After his father's initial rapid growth - thanks to the funds he had raised from the Illis family through his marriage - the Klauswitz Empire had hit a wall. For months, it had remained stagnant - unable to make any real progress or outmaneuver the ruthless rivals who were now closing in from all sides.

Againts his best efforts, Jeff Klauswitz knew that his chances of survival in this cutthroat business world were growing slimmer by the day. His enemies were relentless, and his resources were dwindling - leaving him with little room to maneuver or make a comeback.

Even if his father had luck on his side, it was a game that would cease as soon as Franz acquired the family firm.

This was the most fitting conclusion given that the beloved son who had striven to become a nobleman would ultimately bring the family to ruin.

Yet, what moved him wasn't the rage and retaliation that everyone was talking about.

They were already meaningless to Bastian. Since he left that household, it had already been that way.

Bastian had a different opinion from his maternal grandfather who claimed it was because they made his heart ache. It was not bad for him to have the disease to live with if this composure was a result of the illness.

Nonetheless, his grandpa favored it.

He died without even properly closing his eyes because he had lived with the resentment of not being able to exact revenge for his daughter's unjust death. To the son of his daughter, he left everything.

Bastian received more than simply a hefty inheritance as the Illis family's heir. He owed it to his maternal grandfather, who delivered him from that misery and provided him with the greatest affection and resources, to close his eyes.

Even so, he wished to guarantee it unequivocally. His father had sacrificed his wife and child to gain the great honor and lineage he had. Partial aristocratic standing. Without money, would it truly be so good?

If his father lost everything he had made thanks to the money from the junk dealer he hated so much, the solution would become apparent. If his father went bankrupt but was still content to hold that shell, Bastian considered appreciating his father.

The success of this case was crucial to accelerate the plan, as it was necessary to decrease reliance on Laviere. While he currently maintained an amicable relationship with Laviere and worked together with him, there was no permanent ally. This was also why Sandrine was his most valuable asset, as her mixed heritage provided the most effective safety net.

What if he could soar without the aid of Laviere's wings?

 As the Gulf of Ardene loomed in the distance, an unfamiliar family unexpectedly crossed his mind. Although it was not entirely out of the question, taking such a challenging path seemed unnecessary when he already had a powerful alliance that fulfilled all his requirements. With a decisive conclusion, Bastian shifted gears once again and accelerated his pace.

As the mansion loomed closer, the memory of this morning's fortune-telling nonsense lingered in his mind. "It's the bolt of wisdom. You will have an important realization today." Odette continued to speak eloquently while examining the long, thin eggshells that had shattered.

Bastian was keeping his eye on her to see how far she would go before ending the con. He also realized that it would be better to wed Sandrine, suggesting that perhaps Odette's absurd forecast was correct after all.

He arrived at the home as the sun was setting.

Bastian marched into the lobby after handing the car to the attendant, who fled out in shock. The butler, who had been informed of his earlier return, had just arrived as he set foot on the central staircase.

"Master, you're ba…,"

“Bastian!”  

Before Lovis could finish, Odette's voice rang out clearly, calling his name. Turning his head towards the landing, Bastian saw Odette making her way down the entrance hall, accompanied by a man holding a child.

Bastian was caught off guard by the unexpected arrival of Maxime von Xander


Chapter 59.
Classy Scandal.


"If I departed without seeing Captain Klauswitz, I thought it would be unfortunate. I am happy you are here.” Maxime hastily handed over his daughter to the nanny who was following behind as he expressed his disappointment about leaving without meeting Captain Klauswitz.

"Good day, Sir Xanders," Bastian replied as he shook the Count's hand. "I wasn't anticipating your visit to my humble abode." He glanced briefly at Odette, who had approached him silently, before returning his attention to Maxime. Despite the unexpectedness of the Count's arrival, Maxime's cheerful countenance betrayed no hint of remorse.

"Ah, let me start by apologizing for my rudeness. I came without making an appointment beforehand," Maxime said.

"Is there something urgent that requires your attention?" asked Bastia.

Maxime's expression was filled with genuine remorse, "I wanted to invite both of you to my villa to properly apologize for Alma's mistake at the last party. However, due to some family matters, I must leave Ardene earlier than planned."

Bastian greeted the Count's explanation with a warm, amiable smile. Although there were no overt signs of any foul play, he couldn't claim to fully comprehend the Count's reasoning.

The Count possessed an abundance of kindness that had the ability to win over even the most skeptical of souls. However, despite his outwardly humble demeanor, his true nature was one of arrogance, much like a wolf in sheep's clothing. What made it all the more perplexing was that he seemed completely oblivious to this fact, as if he were under some sort of enchantment that prevented him from recognizing his own flaws.

"If that's the case, why don't you join us for dinner tonight?" Bastian extended a gracious invitation to him. Though he felt that their relationship wasn't particularly significant, he understood the importance of maintaining civility and adhering to social norms.

Maxime chuckled like a carefree youth and shook his head, "No, thank you for the offer, but I must be on my way to catch the train on time. I only stopped by to say hello before my departure."

"All right, let's get a cup of tea. I won't feel comfortable if you go in this manner.” Bastian insisted.

"I had the pleasure of having tea time with Mrs. Klauswitz earlier. Please don't worry about that, as she treated an unexpected and uninvited guest with exceptional hospitality. Alma and I are truly grateful for your kindness."

In response, Odette smiled warmly and expressed her pleasure in being able to extend hospitality to Maxime and Alma.

"I would like to once again apologize for Alma's mistake on that day. I will make sure to educate my child properly to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future."

 Maxime offered a sincere apology to Bastian,  As he spoke, the nanny arrived holding the child, catching Maxime's eye.

The Count gathered his daughter Alma into his arms and approached Bastian once more, urging her to apologize for her mistake. "Come on, Alma. It's important that you apologize to Captain Klauswitz," 

However, upon meeting Bastian's gaze, Alma became overwhelmed with emotion and buried her face in her father's embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Bastian was actually unaware of what mistake the child had made. He observed the father and daughter spending time with a woman who bore a striking resemblance to the Count's deceased wife, and noted Odette's excessive display of affection towards a stranger's child. It all left him with a sense of intrigue and curiosity.

It seemed to Bastian that the adults were trying to shift the responsibility for their mistakes onto a child who was completely innocent and unaware of what had transpired. He couldn't help but think that if the Count was truly apologetic, he wouldn't have shown up again.

As Bastian observed the Count's comically arrogant behavior, the child in his arms began to squirm and open her mouth, perhaps sensing the tension in the air.

“I’m sorry….Captain.” Alma apologized to Captain Klauswitz in a quiet whisper. Her frightened eyes brimming with tears. Even with tears filled her frightened eyes, the child did her part quite resolutely.

Bastian gracefully cocked his head to accept the young lady's audacity. He was instantly distracted, though, when his perceptive eye caught a glimpse of something odd. The child's blouse's collar was embellished with a piece of commonplace lace that, although being common, had an oddly familiar color and shape. His intuition was confirmed as he looked at it more attentively; it was the wonderfully made collar that Odette had been diligently knitting over the last few days.

There was no denying it - Bastian's heart raced with excitement as he beheld the accessory before him. It was not a figment of his imagination; it was real, and he had committed every minute detail to memory. From the tiniest intricacy to the grander purpose of the seemingly insignificant object, he had scrutinized it with unwavering curiosity.

Maxime showed his love and pride for his daughter by giving her several gentle kisses on the cheeks. Bastian had a glimpse of Odette in the child's dazzling grin at this very moment. While they may have had different physical characteristics, there was an unmistakable similarity in the way they made an impact on others around them.

"Allow me to extend an invitation for both of you to visit Xander's estate in the near future. It would be my pleasure to repay the debt," said Maxime before they were informed that the car had arrived. With that, Maxime bid his final farewell.

Bastian stood with Odette, watching the guests say their goodbyes as they left. The fact that Xander's car was already loaded with their luggage and standing outside the stately home suggested that the Count's assurance to drop by before departing was sincere. The father and daughter got into the car and drove off into the peaceful, dusk landscape.

After a moment, Odette turned to face Bastian. "Congratulations on being accepted into Xander's circle," she exclaimed, as if it were a tremendous honor to win the favor of the wealthy widower. However, Bastian's mood became even more tumultuous at the sight of her dazzling smile.

Mrs. Klauswitz, who put a lot of effort into everything, didn't shirk her responsibility to select a compatible affair partner. It was a commendably excellent professional skill.



As nightfall descended, the forest was cloaked in darkness. Odette set down her wine glass and gazed out the window of the breakfast room, her expression etched with concern. It had been nearly ten days since she began caring for the stray dogs in the woods. Though they remained untamed and cautious, they consistently returned to the same spot each day, waiting for her to arrive with their food during her walks.

Today was no exception to the routine. Letting out a sigh, Odette redirected her attention to the table.  ‘What if I request to be excused first?’

Odette thought about her prior choice as she struggled with her emotions. She wasn't ready to take on the responsibilities of a marriage just yet. She resisted letting her feelings endanger the crucial matters of the day.

"After the naval festival is over, would be the optimal time to pay a visit to the Xanders, don't you think?" Odette spoke up, breaking the oppressive silence with her well-timed words. Bastian, who had been silently clearing his plate, finally lifted his gaze across the table.

"Do as you please." Setting down his wine glass, Bastian responded in a curt tone.  It was clear that he wasn't pleased with the newfound connections she had formed. Though she wasn't seeking praise, his disapproving reply was somewhat disconcerting.

"Is it possible that you harbor some dislike towards Sir Xanders?" Amidst her struggle, Odette approached the topic cautiously.

Bastian's face lit up with a smile as the candelabra's glow illuminated the dining table. "I can hardly believe it," he said. "I believe Count Xanders has the potential to create a tasteful scandal. It's a valuable network, so be sure to handle it with care."

Bastian continued speaking in his usual plain and soft tone, without any change in his expression.

 "Do you suspect that Sir Xanders and I are currently engaged in an inappropriate relationship?" Odette asked.

"Whether the two of you are in a committed relationship or simply sharing a noble friendship is of no concern to me. I simply require that Maxime von Xanders be the cause of our divorce," Bastian nonchalantly raised his eyebrows and resumed his use of cutlery. "He is a wealthy, well-mannered, and highly-educated nobleman, which is sufficient reason for me to relinquish my wife. You have chosen your partner wisely, Odette, and I am pleased with your selection."

Bastian sliced through the meat, spewing vile and vicious words without a care. Odette was left speechless, frozen in shock as she observed the unsettling spectacle. If she had mustered the courage to speak out against his behavior, it might have been dismissed as a mere misunderstanding. However, Bastian's demeanor was chillingly devoid of any empathy or warmth. His behavior was cold, like ice.

The scene brought back thoughts of that tragic spring afternoon when Bastian had proposed and given her a contract. She was now expecting an explanation from him, but all she got was a placid demeanor as he carried on eating. She was suddenly repelled by the meat's dark red interior, which had barely undergone surface cooking. It was a reflection of the man who was avidly munching the bloodied meat from the seat across from her.

He was a beast, or at least he looked like a beast in Odette's eyes.

Odette had known for a long time that this man would use any strategy to further his goals, but this affair was much beyond her comprehension.

"Sir Xanders has nothing to do with me. I am willing to agree to any grounds for the divorce, but I refuse to let an innocent person be dragged into this." 

"Perhaps it's time for you to work on building a good relationship," Bastian suggested, swallowing the last morsel of meat and reaching for the napkin. "It looks good on you, by the way" he added with a nonchalant smile as he neatly folded the napkin he had just used to wipe his lips.

A terrible man.

Odette had to work to keep her hatred from escaping her mouth. She immediately concealed her hands under the table, but they were already trembling with unfathomable wrath.

"Sir Xanders is a decent man. Please don't make careless insults," Odette reprimanded Bastian, assuming the role of a stern teacher. Bastian laughed as if he had heard the funniest joke and refilled his empty glass.

"Isn't it great that you two are perfect for each other? I'm just glad that my wife is leaving me for a decent man, at least it'll make me look good. You'll have a wonderful husband, and I don't think there could be a better outcome," 

"I'm sorry, what did you just say?" Odette asked, taken aback by the comment.

“Don't worry, I will pay alimony for that portion if you want. Of course, you will have to face the harm to your image caused by you and Count Xanders having an affair.” 

“Do you really think that money can buy anything?” 

"You have proven that nothing is impossible." 

"You are quite filthy." Odette let her anger speak.

"Is cleanliness your virtue? And who sold their life for money?" Bastian, clutching his wine glass, responded with a question and a statement that sounded like a song.

Odette's pale blue face was filled with a fierce glare as she rose to her feet. Though her eyes were reddened with tears, she refused to let them fall.

As he listened to the sound of his wife's footsteps fading away, Bastian slowly tipped his glass. The butler had carefully selected the wine for the master and his wife's dinner, and the rich, fragrant aroma filled the air.


Chapter 60.
Don't Let This Night Ruin Me.


Beneath the shade of the maple tree, where unspoken promises lingered in the air, an empty tin can was all that remained.

Odette rushed over to inspect it, scanning her surroundings for any sign of the stray dogs that had been causing trouble. They were nowhere to be found, as she had expected, but the sight still left her feeling a little disheartened. She, wanted or unwanted, blamed Bastian for stirring all this chaos.

Despite her awareness that her resentment was misplaced, Odette's hatred for Bastian refused to subside.

If only he had arrived home after Count Xanders had left, they never would have crossed paths. Odette despised the thought of making excuses for herself, but her mind wouldn't let go of the self-justification

Her words, spoken in anger, were carried away on the chilling wind that shook the night forest, as if they were mere leaves scattered in its wake. "Bad man," she muttered, as if the words themselves held the power to release the frustration building up inside her.

"I will never shed a tear over this marriage," she vowed to herself, willing her resolve to remain steadfast.

As the previously blurry landscape came back into focus, Odette made her way towards the maple tree that marked the entrance to the path. With gentle hands, she cleared away the dry leaves and discarded acorn shells that had accumulated in the nearby tin can.

With a sigh, Odette rose to her feet and dusted off her hands. "Oh, Puppy," she called out into the darkness of the path ahead.

As the sound of flapping wings faded away, the forest once again descended into silence, leaving Odette alone with her thoughts.

She called out for the dogs several more times, but received no response. Exhausted, Odette leaned against the trunk of a magnificent tree and contemplated her next move.

She knew she should hurry back, having used the excuse of taking a stroll around the garden for a brief respite. But something within her urged her to wait a little longer, to give the dogs a chance to return. 

Other animals might steal the food if she left it in this condition.

The sound of a nightingale singing appeared out of nowhere. Odette listened to the song while quietly closing her eyes.

Hui-hwi! The clear, haunting melody began like a simple whistle, but as the musician's skilled fingers danced across the strings, it transformed into a symphony of sound, rich and vibrant with a variety of techniques.

The nightingale was her mother's favorite bird, and it was easy to see why. Even when she could no longer attend the grand theaters and hear the sweeping orchestras that once filled her life with joy, the sweet songs of the nightingale still brought her comfort and peace.

On the night of the last nightingale's song, Odette sat by her mother's bedside, holding her hand as she listened to the haunting melody that filled the room. It was then that her mother whispered a secret wish - that in her next life, she would be reborn as the nightingale, singing with a voice as pure and sweet as the bird that had brought her so much joy.

"But can't you only sing beautifully when you're filled with pain and emotion?" Odette asked her mother, watching as she closed the window to shut out the chill of the night air. "You always said that music should come from the heart."

Her mother helplessly smiled at her daughter's words "You have such a curious mind, my dear.”

Curious mind…

The mother who regularly polished Odette mumbled some strange words of regret.

“Odette. I love you, my daughter."

Her mother covered her face with a thin hand after lengthy moments of devoted attention to her.

"Should the time come when I can no longer shield you from harm, my darling, promise me you'll live as a blissful fool," She implored, her tear-stained face illuminated by the moonlight. It was a strange and enigmatic request.

"I’m sorry…."

After giving that final word, her mother sighed deeply and drifted off to sleep as if it were carrying the weight of her entire existence. Helen, the unlucky princess, died unexpectedly the following morning.

The act of betrayal was undeniable. For Odette, her mother had been her everything. She taught her every little thing - from speaking, walking, and laughing, to observing, listening, and reflecting. When Odette was no longer able to have a tutor, her mother became her teacher.

Her mother didn't spare her, not even when her feet hurt from dancing in uncomfortable shoes or when her knuckles swelled from hitting the piano keys when she couldn't play well.

She continued to learn by reading library books, and when she fell short of her mother's expectations, she would receive a ruthless spanking. Her mother remained hopeful that one day they would regain their former high status. For that phantom.

As Odette received the heartless master's final command for her to become a fool, disbelief consumed her. She had always been a dutiful daughter, following her mother's every instruction, but she refused to comply with this last wish.

She didn't want to follow the pointless ambitions that had plagued her mother her entire life. She simply didn't want to abandon the life she had so far devoted to it. After all, she wasn’t her mother; her mother had eventually given up and fled.

Yet, now her life was the same now since, as the man claimed, she sold her life for money.

‘One day, I'll be living in my own home and leading the life I want to lead.’

The notion of glory that didn't truly belong to her was of no interest to Odette, regardless of the location. What truly captured her imagination was the possibility of finding a place where she could shed her false identity and be truly herself. As she contemplated the end of her marriage, Odette couldn't help but dream of a future where she could make that a reality.

Her closed eyes slowly opened to the sound of the nightingale's incessant cries. As she listened to the bird's melodious song, a thought crossed her mind - what if her mother had returned as a bird and sang to her about leaving without being taught? The idea brought a bittersweet feeling.

Odette adjusted her stance and took a breath while checking the clock.

She had no regrets, so perhaps her mother was correct. She had to make the most of the decision she had already made.

She refused to follow her mother's sad life, which she blamed on being imprisoned in the past. Never, never, never.

“Puppy.” Odette let out one final call for the stray dogs, but as she turned to leave, she caught a glimpse of a pup emerging from the nearby bushes. Though she searched for the mother dog, who had always followed her child, she was nowhere to be seen.

As Odette approached the lone pup, "What are you doing here all alone? Where's your mother?" But the frightened pup just whimpered and darted off into the pathless woods without even glancing at the food she had brought.

Odette did not move, so the dog returned and growled. It appeared to be beckoning her to follow him.

Odette stared blankly into the pitch-black trees. Once more, the puppy began to run in its direction.



The night was drawing to a close, yet Odette had not returned.

 Bastian grew anxious as he lit his third cigarette and rose from his seat. Even though, Odette had said she was going for a leisurely walk in the garden, even Lovis had witnessed her departure.

Bastian's patience wore thin as the hours passed and Odette failed to return. He couldn't fathom why she would storm out of the mansion in anger, putting herself in potential danger.

Her behavior was out of character for the responsible and level-headed Odette. What's worse, she knew the consequences of defying their agreement, making her actions all the more reckless and worrisome to Bastian.

Bastian glanced at his watch once more before making his way to the window that overlooked the garden. As he drew back the curtains, he was met with the sight of a gentle rain shower that had crept up on him unnoticed, painting the glass pane with droplets.

Stepping out onto the balcony, he felt the cool breeze that carried the scent of the rain on his skin. Bastian sighed in resignation and hastily started getting ready to depart.

All he did was cover up his clothing with a raincoat. There was no time to be concerned about anything else.

As he descended to the first-floor hall, Lovis met him with an anxious expression. "I'll mobilize the servants to search for madam." 

“No. One is sufficient."  Without pausing, Bastian shook his head. A rapid and discrete solution was required in order to prevent the spread of unneeded misinformation. Little disputes and resolutions. So that it might represent a typical couple's day to day activities.

"Stop worrying, Lovis. Odette may be somewhere I already know." Bastian quickly departed the estate after deceiving the butler with a cunning tale.

Odette would have hidden farther away if she had remained in the garden, where he would have seen her long ago. She was probably in the woods because the beach that he had often observed through the window was deserted.

Bastian's mind raced as he swiftly made his way towards his destination. His footsteps pounded against the forest floor, quickening with every passing moment. The rain pelted down around him, a familiar and unwelcome sensation. 

It had been years since he had wandered through the Ardene forests on a night like this, but the memories flooded back to him in a rush, overpowering and vivid.

-

With a jolt, Bastian realized he was no longer in his cozy bed, but in the midst of a vast forest, dressed only in his pajamas and barefoot. As he tried to make sense of what had happened, his mind slowly cleared and a sense of calm overtook him.

"I sleepwalk," Bastian murmured to himself, as he embraced the cold, rainy darkness of the forest.

Bastian already knew that while he was asleep, he occasionally prowled the night like a ghost. He had long ago reached the point when he could no longer continue to live in denial and conceal his condition.

That explained it. Before going to sleep, he began to tie rope around his wrists. Hence, nobody would learn. The only thing would be to wake up chained and alone.

Bastian had become an expert at concealing his weakness, and he knew that if he woke up early enough and erased all traces, he could keep it hidden. Despite moving to the Illis’s residence, the nights of wandering continued to haunt him, but he was able to keep them under wraps. However, one fateful weekend morning, after several months of living with his grandfather, Bastian slipped up and revealed his vulnerability. His carelessness had led him to oversleep.

Curiosity had seized his grandfather, compelling him to open the locked door and peer inside. What he discovered was his grandson sprawled on the bedroom floor, as if he had been tamed like an animal on a leash. Bastian jolted awake at the sound of his grandfather's piercing screams.

"Who did this to you? Who made you like this? Tell me now!" His grandfather's anger was palpable as he quickly untied the rope and interrogated Bastian, 

“Sir, I did."  Little Bastian replied in a collected manner. His fight while restrained by his rope had left him with wounds that were oozing with blood, but the discomfort was not severe enough to warrant concern.

That fateful morning, the world seemed to crumble as his grandfather wept uncontrollably, shattering the silence around them. With a pang of regret, Bastian wished he hadn't slept in and made matters worse by uttering something he shouldn't have.

Determined to find a cure for Bastian's sleepwalking, his grandfather scoured the vast empire for a solution. With unwavering commitment, Bastian underwent the treatment, silently enduring the process. The passing of time brought with it the sweet relief of a complete cure, as well as the fading of scars on his wrists.

-

Bastian came to a halt at the end of the path that connected the dense forest to the sandy beach, rain pelting his face and chilling him to the bone. As he wiped the droplets from his skin, he felt the memories of the past fading into nothingness, leaving behind only one constant thought: Odette.

The elusive and vexing woman had disappeared without a trace, even after he had combed the trails that wound through the forest.

Bastian drew in a deep breath, his heart pounding with determination as he lengthened his strides. He knew that Odette was somewhere within the sprawling grounds of the grand mansion, even if she had lost her way. The chances of a catastrophic accident were low, but still, he couldn't shake the intense emotions that consumed him.

The memory of the unpleasant dinner table argument lingered, and despite his knowledge of her  innocence, he couldn't stop the hurtful words that had slipped from his tongue. 

Bastian became dejected as he realized that this kind of conflict was all too often. Yet he didn't let it break him; he used his fortitude and fortitude to confront it. He set out to locate the starting place with fresh vigor.

Although there were still traces of winter in the air, the setting sun shed a warm glow over the early spring evening. And it was at this precise time that the unlucky woman took off her veil.

He felt a sense of regret as he realized he should have taken the chance that fateful night. In the stillness of the night, the burden of his inaction weighed heavily on him. He might have been nothing more than a fleeting memory or a one-night stand if he had just seized the chance. Even if destiny reunited them as husband and wife, their relationship would never be the same as it may have been.

The emperor's decree held immense weight, but even its power could not compel him to cross paths again with the woman who peddled her flesh in the shadowy corners of the gambling den. He had brought her into his world, against his better judgment, and it was a mistake that could not be undone. But if this was to be the end, then it should be concluded with precision, according to plan.

Bastian's mind sliced through the haze of uncertainty with a resolute decision, much like the young boy of his past who bound his own wrists to shield himself from the tumultuous nights.

He noticed the presence of people on the road going to the cliff overlooking the sea about the time he understood that more searches would be required.

With cautious steps, Bastian drew closer to the towering tree that stood sentinel at the edge of the cliff. A heavy exhale escaped his lips as he spotted a figure beneath its gnarled roots, lost in deep contemplation.

"Odette," 

He breathed, the sound barely audible above the rustling leaves.

At the sound of her name, the woman caked in mud slowly turned her head towards him. And in that moment, Bastian knew that it was his wife, Odette.
