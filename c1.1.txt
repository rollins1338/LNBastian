“Master, would it not be better to go out looking for Mrs Klauswitz?”

   Bastian looked up at the clock, eight o’clock, he had already delayed dinner twice. He closed the paper he had been reading. He couldn’t afford to remain idle any longer.

   “There’s no need to cause any unnecessary commotion.”

   “But madam is still…”

   “I will take care of finding my wife,” Bastian said, cutting of Hans. He calmly stood up from his armchair, tossing the paper onto the side table. Hans hurried to fetch Bastian’s coat.

   Bastian snatched up the coat as he left the room. The Becker couple were still in the hotel, gathering their friends for a pre-wedding party, revelling in the joy of their union. Seeing Tira’s face, which was aglow of happiness, made Odette even more ridiculous. Could he even say that it's unrequited love?  She gave her all to her little sister, yet the treatment she received remained nothing but indifference.

   Bastian strode across the lobby with certainty and out into the cold night. Tira wouldn’t have been any help any way, so Bastian left her to enjoy the party without her sister. He would let Odette continue to experience that unrequited love. 

Bastian followed the river toward the amusement park, the Ferris Wheel his guide. She was bound to be in that place. He had no real evidence to base this thought, only that Odette was a predictable woman and it didn’t take long for his hunch to be confirmed correct.

   From the other side of the road leading to the amusement park they had visited together once, he could see Odette approaching him, walking away from the amusement park. It couldn’t see her face from the distance and the gloom of the night, but he could tell it was her.

   She was dressed in attire not suitable for the cold night, like her determination would be enough to keep her bones warm. It was hard to consider anyone could be warm enough with just a simple shawl draped on their shoulders.

   Bastian was about to call out to her, but then had a change of heart and simply stood under the gas lamp to wait for her. Although each step seemed tired and drawn, Odette was still stood upright, like she was on parade. She walked with stubborn determination. She was practically right next to Bastian before she even noticed another person standing in front of her, let alone who that person was.

   “Bastian?” she squeaked in surprise.

   She clutched her hands to her chest and looked at him with wide, wet eyes. When ever she blinked, she shadow of her eyelashes made her look ever more desolate.

   Trading her life, betraying the deal and then returning right back where it all started. Odette could not escape her fate and served only to deepen Bastian’s luck, which had yet to be kind.

   Letting out a sigh, Bastian wrapped his coat around Odette, who was visibly shivering. Odette looked like she was about to refuse he offer, but was too weak to say or do anything but let him drape it over her shoulders. He expected her to lose consciousness at any second.

   She staggered and Bastian caught her. With the woman in his arms, he made his way back to the hotel. Although it would have been much quicker to go through the main entrance, Bastian decided to take her round the back to a side entrance instead, so that Tira wouldn’t know about her elder sisters misfortune, not that he thought she would care.

   The Emperor had abandoned an over used chess piece.

   The Father drew his last breath.

   And the Sister would leave in search of her own happiness.

   Odette was now a lonely island, there was nothing left.

   And he was her one and only saviour and judge.

   Bastian smiled with satisfaction.

Chapter 122.
Last Homework.



Bastian had kept his promise. It hadn’t been until the Becker couple had announced their marriage did the reality of the situation really sank in, though he applauded like everyone else, it was merely an act.

   The ceremony ended with the newly weds kissing and sealing their vows.

   Odette offered a sincere applause and wished the couple all the best for the future. It was a moment where all past efforts were finally rewarded and Odette knew that all her efforts had not turned to ash. This marriage had a meaningful ending.

   Odette did her best to believe that this was best. She did not want to entertain the reoccurring doubts that occasional crept into her mind. This seemed right and fitting.

   “Surprising, isn’t it?” Bastian said in a low whisper. “Its your sisters wedding, the last member of your family, and you can’t bring yourself to shed a single tear.”

   Odette glared at him, while Bastian maintained a mocking glint in his eyes. Those sharp blue eyes brought back memories of last night, which caused her to flush.

   The warmth of the coat he put around her shattered defences and the way he held her, she wished everything would break apart and disappear. Her memories of getting back to the hotel were fragmented. Odd images of maids being ushered out of the room. Frigid fingers peeling off her clothes, something like a strong embrace that held her freezing body. 

Although she knew she should push Bastian away, she could not find the strength to do so. She didn’t want to face a man she couldn’t push away and the whole night she wished not to be comforted.

However, ath the end, Odette surrendered as though she had accepted her fate. Their bond had grown so deep that it reached the realm of intimacy, erasing any remaining distance that had once separated them. She wished for the night to quickly pass, before losing consciousness. 

As the night drew to a close and dawn neared,  she woke up from her deep sleep in Bastian's embrace, his arms wrapped around her tightly.

Confusion filled her gaze as she stared at the man before her-Bastian still lost in his slumber. Despite their tight embrace, nothing happened.

Why? This peculiar situation left her utterly surprised. An answer eluded her grasp. While grappling with these enigmatic questions, the soft morning light gradually filtered through the curtains, casting its gentle glow.

Until the first light of dawn gradually unveiled the veil of night, Odette stared at Bastian's face as he slept. She tenderly brushed his strands of hair that fell to his forehead. The soft texture she felt beneath her touch reassured her that it wasn’t a dream.

Odette mustered her remaining strength to push Bastian's encircling arms from around her waist, and part their entwined legs. After freeing herself from his embrace, she  sat on the bed’s edge, waiting her dizziness to recede.

When she rose to her feet, Bastian woke up and looked at her with clear and cool eyes, unlike someone who had just woken up. His eyes leisurely traced her bare shoulders and chest. A delicate blush tinted her cheeks and in a quick reaction, she grasped the sheet to cover her unclothed body.

Odette averted her eyes in embarrassment when Bastian rose from the bed, revealing his entirely naked form without a single thread in the unforgiving sunlight.

Unlike Odette who looked confuse, Bastian was calm. He leisurely sipped water from a glass on the bedside table before wearing his nightgown, his platinum hair gently brushed aside and he made his way towards the bathroom.

When she heard the shower Odette heaved a sigh of relief. Yet, her heart continued to race and her cheeks remained flushed.

A twisted thought crossed her mind: maybe it would be better to let his greed run wild. It seemed nothing more than a familiar stroke of misfortune, one she had grown used to. She felt embarrassed as she realized she wasn't accustomed to being allowed rest and given such peaceful moments, and she despised that foreign feeling.

"You seem relieved." after watching Odette for a long time, Bastian asked.

Odette woke up from her reverie and immediately looked away without answering. She thought, it would be better if Bastian misunderstood that her bond with Tira was not as close as he believed.

   “Sister,” Tira called out, breaking their uncomfortable conversation.

   Odette embraced her sister as if she had not seen her in years, as if it were just the two of them in the whole world. Odette remained confident that her love for this child was unchanged, even though they had been relegated to this pitiful end, Odette did not regret her decision. Tira’s happiness was enough of a reward.

   But why was she still full of regret?

   Just like everything else, Odette avoided that question as best she could and wiped away Tira’s tears. She could feel Bastian’s gaze on her, but she resisted the urge to look back at him. By tomorrow everything would be over and that would be enough. That was how it had to be.



Odette bid farewell to her sister out the front of the hotel. Once again, thanks to Bastian arranging everything, she was able to say one last heartfelt goodbye to Tira.

   “You need to be happy, that’s all that matters, okay?” Odette said, swallowing sobs. Tira nodded emphatically, unable to say anything.

   “I, er, sorry, but we really need to get going,” Nick said, gingerly interrupting the two hugging sisters.

   Odette looked around with red eyes. The group that had accompanied Tira’s weddings were also leaving and were prepared to leave with the Becker’s, who were set to leave on a passenger ship the next morning.

   “Goodbye, Tira,” Odette said one last time.

   Tira now had her own world to think about, and in that world, there would be no place for Odette just yet. Accepting this was hard, but Odette calmly bid them farewell, leaving many unsaid words to remain buried deep in her heart. She didn’t want to sully this moment with bad memories and disturbed thoughts.

   “I love you,” Tira called back to Odette.

   “I love you too, sister,” Odette said in return, emotion lingering on the words. Tira didn’t seem to notice it, she held her husbands hand and stepped off into the new world with their child. Their car departed just as soon as the door was closed.

   Odette no longer held onto futile regrets as she turned around. She knew that Tira was waving her hand out of the window, but Odette didn’t look back. She passed through the lobby of the hotel, took the elevator and walked the long corridor back to her room, always looking ahead.

   Now was the time to be thinking about what came next. There was no room for thinking about the past.



I will be on the train to Felia this time tomorrow. Odette thought to herself as she paced around the sitting room, organising the plan in her head.

   She was going to visit the Herhardt’s with Bastian first and then find the opportune time to head into the city. Since the men were going to stay at the hunting grounds until late, it wasn’t going to be too difficult.

   She was going to return to the hotel, pack her belongings, collect Margrethe and head to the station. There should be a clear two hours before the train left for Felia. There would be a total of four departures, just in case.

   She was planning to catch the 4pm train, but if that failed, there were other options. Not being able to see Tira set sail was regrettable, but necessary if she wanted to get out of the city as fast as possible.

   Odette already had some of her stuff packed, to reduce the time it would take to gather her things together. She double checked her bags, her money and checked her pocket watch, which she had brought along to help her keep time. It was almost five o’clock now. The maid would be along to check on dinner plans.

   Odette sat on the bed, waiting for Molly and as if on cue, she knocked on the door. “The master will return later this evening, so I have been instructed to only bring the mistresses dinner tonight. Is that okay?”

   “Sit down, Molly, I have something I need to discuss with you.” Odette gestured to the chair opposite her.

   Molly laughed as if they were playing a game. She didn’t show any signs of shock or surprise as she locked the rooms door securely before sitting down.

   “Have you sorted out your thoughts now?” Molly said. “Theodora Klauswitz wants to get rid of you, they say. According to my aunt, it's because you’ve caught the eye of young master Franz.”

   Though Odette knew this was nonsense, she nodded in agreement, offering vague understanding. Inter-family conflicts among the wealthy was of no concern to her, regardless of how they turned out.

   What was important to Molly was that once this was over, she needed not work the tiresome role of maid any longer. With Odette gone, she would be justly rewarded for her part and she could use that money to buy herself a nice house and live comfortably. Given all that she had done for Theodora, the reward would be extensive.

   “Make sure to leave tomorrow, Molly, it doesn’t matter where, but it would be best to be as far away from here as possible,” Odette said sternly.

   Molly frowned at Odette quizzically. “What are you talking about?”

   “By tomorrow, Bastian will know who you really are, why you’re here and who sent you. He will know everything you have done so far. He will not let you off easily.” Odette fixed Molly with a calm stare.

   Molly nervously fiddled with her apron. “Could it be that this time you plan to plead with your husband? Secure a position at his side by gaining his trust?”

   “Don’t misunderstand me, Molly, you don’t play such an important role that I could tolerate you any longer, I’ve grown tired of your sneaking about, so disappear. I will consider looking the other way as you do so, in return for all the favours you have done for me.”

    Molly rose to her feet in shock. “Do you think Major Klauswitz is going to let you continue to play the part of hostess once you give birth to a child? Even in your wildest dreams, you can’t really be that stupid.”

   “Sit down, Molly,” Odette ordered.

   Molly snorted and grinned menacingly. “Do you really still want to play the role of aristocrat? The entire empire knows that you are a beggar princess…”

   Before Molly could finish her sentence, pain exploded across her face and her ears rang.

Chapter 123.


Everything is in vain.




Molly staggered back in shock, bringing a hand up to hold her cheek where Odette had slapped her. She could barely comprehend what had happened.

   “Who do you think you are, hitting me?” Molly said, her eyes going wide.

   “I suggest you leave at the first chance you get and don’t even think about going to Bastian,” Odette said flatly.

   “How amusing,” Molly smirked, “now you decide to play the good wife, even after you stabbed your husband in the back. You’re a wicked woman.”

   Odette didn’t hesitate in slapping Molly again, a quick, sharp movement. She remained a cool look as she did so, forcing Molly to swallow her pride.

   “I will tell Bastian, if you refuse even my slightest favour,” Odette said.

   “Do you really think you will be alright after that?”

   “I’ve already exposed all my weaknesses, I have nothing left to loose.”

   “I don’t think it will matter much, if I tell your husband about your fraternising with Franz Klauswitz.”

   “That would be a sure way to turn your real master into an enemy, do you think you will be able to handle that?” Odette’s tone was merciless as she pushed a box across the table at Molly. Hesitantly, Molly took it and inside was a silver candle stick and wine cup.

   “What’s this?”

   “Tomorrow, rumours will start circulating that you are a petty thief. Its common enough that no one will doubt it, and it will provide a good cover for your disappearance.”

   “What about my compensation? Do you really think I will just go along with this?”

   “Your gift? Whatever you feel like you deserve, you will never see it. You broke your promise to me and Theodora has abandoned you, what gift would such a person deserve?”

   “Don’t talk nonsense.”

   “When Bastian found out and punished me, did you really think the sparks were not going to fly your way?” Odette said, an eyebrow raised high on her brow questioningly. “If I had ever thought you were a threat, I would have told Bastian much sooner, to avoid any unnecessary trouble, but I didn’t. The only reason you have been safe so far was purely because of my leniency. If not for that, you would have been condemned long ago.”

   “That’s…”

   Molly mumbled, her mouth flapping with nonsensical noises as she tried to find some way to bring things back to her advantage. Odette took a step closer.

   “Since I had yet to fulfil my objective, I needed to keep you under surveillance, I needed to keep you close so I could keep an eye on you. Sending you out as a spy would be difficult, given the situation, so I had extended your usefulness, make it seem like you were still an important asset to Theodora. As soon as the opportunity arose to dispose of you, I would and now is that time.”

   Molly couldn’t argue against the indignation, she had been sufficiently cornered by a woman she thought of as being of no consequence or ability. She was in fact a crazy woman.

   Over the past two years, Molly would never have guessed that Odette was concealing such shrewdness. All this time she thought she was a pitiful woman, how had she managed to conceal her true nature all this time? The cold duality of Odette sent shivers down Molly’s spine.

   “That’s all you’ve ever been, Molly, a disposable pawn, with no other benefit than to be able to keep tabs on Theodora Klauswitz.”

   Molly had a sudden thought. “Its strange, how would someone who seems to know everything end up in such a precarious situation?”

   “There is no greater lesson than the ones we have to live through. This precarious situation has taught me well.”

   With a tired smile, Odette turned from Molly and went to the window. The western sky was gradually turning red and the final night was soon to arrive.

   “No, I don’t think so, this flimsy threat will not work on me, I will not succumb to weak blackmail,” Molly said nervously, chewing her lip. Even in that moment, she thought about getting out while she still could. Odette nodded.

   “If you would like to test me, go ahead.”

   “Will driving me away really change anything? You’re finished either way, you’ll be discarded by both sides.”

   Despite Molly’s bitter curse, Odette remained composed. She already knew that she had no one to turn to, it was no big surprise to her. All of this pitiful begging was overwhelmingly hollow.

   “If you are still here when I return tomorrow at noon, I will respect your decision and act accordingly.”

   The conversation was ended when a knock came from the door, another maid came in with the evening meal. After that, things went as predicted. In an instant, Molly retained the impression of being a humble maid. Odette sat at the evening table and watched Molly go about getting everything ready for dinner, though nothing appealed to Odette at the time.

   “If you need anything else, please don’t hesitate to ask,” the maid said when she had finished setting out the evening meal.

   Odette forced a smile as she tried to calm her rumbling tummy, while trying to ignore the sweet smells that enticed her appetite. Molly followed the other maid out of the room, her nervous eyes shifting to Odette.

   Unable to rouse her appetite, even in the face of such a wonderful feast, Odette gazed out of the window at the deepening night. The city lights sparkled, the lights of the Ferris Wheel triggered an intense craving for cotton candy. The desire to indulge in childish snacks was alien to her, yet the longing remained.

   Odette had to confront the truth of her situation. Despite protecting Tira, the reason for choosing this hell, her heart remained empty. A deep void that could not be filled.

   Despite her efforts to try and pull any sort of meaning left in this marriage, ultimately it was as empty as her heart. In the depths of the pit of despair, where nothing could be undone, she had been stained forever in regrets.

   Odette looked like a resigned warrior as she stood from the table, but she couldn’t take a single step, she had no where to go, so she sat back down. She wrapped her arms around herself, hugging her waist and the baby. Her eyes going wide as she realised the truth.

   The food in front of her had gone cold, but as the last mote of sunlight faded away to nothing, Odette forced herself to eat. She might not have any desire to eat, but for the sake of the baby, she needed to consume something.



As Bastian entered the suite and threw his keys onto the counter, Margrethe came bounding out and barking. She stopped in front of the door, yapping at nothing. Her hair was plastered all over the place, like she had just woken from a nap. Bastian laughed, it seemed that the lady Odette had been trying to train was fruitless.

   “Hush,” Bastian hissed, trying his best to settle the dog. It was well past midnight and Odette would be asleep.

   After giving Margrethe a scratch behind the ears, Bastian went into the bedroom. The dog followed him, hovering around his feet as he walked slowly across the hall.

   Bastian had just returned from visiting an Admiral who had been one of his mentors in the academy. The most notable thing about this Admiral was that he could contest Admiral Demel when it came to putting away the drink. Even in his grey haired, wrinkled state, he could still drink far better than Bastian, who wasn’t particularly susceptible to alcohol.

   Bastian stank of alcohol as he stripped off and collapsed on the bed. Margrethe, seeing that there would be no more attention, went and curled up on the armchair by the fire.

Odette was sound asleep, her body curled up like a child's on the wide bed. Looking at her motionless back, he couldn't help but smile sadly as he felt that the previous night, when she had snuggled into his arms for warmth as they fell asleep, now seemed like a distant memory.

It felt like she was always like this. Money, stolen confidential documents or his body heat, she always needed something from him, always trying to take from him.

   Bastian closed his eyes and did his best to ignore the room spinning, concentrating instead on the stable form of Odette’s weak body. The woman that he could have completely possessed and only now did he fully have this woman. The woman he would protect, but not from himself.

   He had never intended to interfere for Tira, her wedding or her emigration. If anything, he would have encouraged her to leave had she not decided to do so on her own. He wanted the youngest daughter of Dyssan to be happy, that way, she would forget her older sister, deepening her isolation.

   Everything had gone to plan without him even lifting a finger.

   Without realising it, Bastian succumb to his fatigue and when he opened his eyes again, the room was already bathed in the deep light of dawn. He looked about the empty room and stopped at the woman standing by the window, bathed in the pale light.

It was his wife, Odette.

Chapter 124.
Double-Edged Blade.



Odette had awaken from the lingering remnants of a dream she was familiar with, a dream she had several times, of walking under the bright green branches of trees in the height of summer. She would come across a man she only knew as the man of the summer solstice, standing in the middle of the road. She could not get hurt here, and under the laced shadows of the trees, she held her head high.

   Odette let out a sigh and sat up in the bed. She could sense his presence next to her, but did not want to turn and look at him, she wanted to believe that she was alone.

   She stood up and moved to the sofa, but didn’t take more than a few steps before she froze in place. Out of the window, she could see the familiar lights flashing beyond. Her groggy eyes, still clouded with sleep, could make out the Ferris Wheel and with it, the question that had plagued her constantly for the last two years.

   ‘What if she hadn’t gone to the amusement park with Tira?’

   The argument between Tira and their father would not have been so intense, they would never have agreed to the two year marriage and the name Bastian Klauswitz would have been just that, a name attached to a rather handsome young man that Odette would never have talked to. Like dried petals kept between the pages of a book, it would have been nothing more than distant memories.

   But the past was not on Odette’s side.

   Perhaps if they had been more sincere with each other, things could have been different. Bastian had been quite friendly back then, perhaps she might have had the courage to talk to him about her departure, maybe she wouldn’t have been so afraid of the harsh words of heartbreak.

   And yet, the light was not on her side either.

   Could they have ever been different to what they are now?

   The destination of her thorny thoughts reached an ultimate question that had been lodged deep in her mind for the past two years. She looked back over at Bastian, the lingering glow of the dim light played over him. Somehow, he had woken up and looked right back at her. Their eyes met in the growing light of dawn, encapsulating them.



Bastian was the first to break the awkward silence. “How does it feel to be alone?” he said, the slur in his words and the sleepiness in his eyes gave away how drunk he was.

   Odette did not answer him, choosing to instead turn from him as she went over to the side table under the window, poured out a glass of water and brought it over to him.

   “What’s this for?”

   “You’re drunk,” Odette said plainly.

   “I know,” Bastian said, given Odette a puzzled look. He took the glass of water when it became clear Odette was not going to move until he took it. “Oh, yeah, I owe you some money, don’t I.” He downed the glass of water and clumsily got off the bed.

   Odette watched him stagger across the bedroom to pull his wallet from his coat. She felt her cheeks heat up from embarrassment, but did her best to ignore it. She did not mind being paid for sex, at least she was getting money to help with her travel expenses.

  The silence stretched on as Bastian stared down at the bills in his wallet, as if he had forgotten what he was doing. The chime of the clock roused him from his stupor and he stumbled over to the chair and sat down, he closed his eyes and breathed deeply.  The cold moonlight came through the window,  illuminating his hand holding the money.

   Odette sighed and approached Bastian, who did not rouse until she reached a hand out to take the money. He looked up at her, his eyes struggling to focus.

   “I will accept payment gratefully,” Odette said as she pulled the bills from the wallet.

   This man was supposed to be someone that would never hurt her, sworn to it when they got married, and yet, everything he seemed to do caused her pain. As he looked at her with those clouded blue eyes, she felt a pain in her chest. She had never given him her heart and yet seeing him in this pitiful state hurt.

   “You’re always like this,” Bastian said with a crooked smile.

   Odette gave him a funny look, which only served to make Bastian laugh as he thought Odette was about to cry. He realised that he must look equally funny in his intoxicated state.

   Inside he cursed his choice to marry this woman. He despised the Emperor's hypocrisy, who gave him burdens like he was the empire's hero. He also hated Duke Dyssen, the most incompetent fool, wasting his fortune in back alley gambling dens.

   It had all been in vain. He regained some mote of his sense of self and found he had been marching on the spot, trapped in the remnants of a deceitful love, like a chained dog waiting for its owner.

"Please settle the bill accurately." Shereached out and grabbed the money in Bastian's hand.  


Odette looked at him with what looked to be pity, or disgust. All his efforts to hurt this woman felt like he had the double-edged blade turned the wrong way and the more he tried to wield it, the more of his blood was spilled.

   How much more must I endure until you break?


What am I looking for when you break?

   Clutching the money in his hand, Bastian’s frustrations grew like an inferno, fed by his passion, he could no longer hold back his emotions as he looked at Odette, who did not cry even though she was full of sadness.

  Twisted with agitation, he threw the money into the fireplace and stumbled over to the window and stared out at the blurred lights of the Ferris Wheel. That damned woman loved those twinkling lights. Feeling like he was suffocating, Bastian turned around and burst into laughter.

   Odette was bending over and picking up scattered money in front of the fireplace. Her figure, as she was bent over, reminded him of a graceful swan.

   Bastian could understand why the Princess went into a rage when she saw Odette picking up broken jewellery. Odette was a woman with the knack for humbling her opponents.

Bastian's approaching footsteps could be heard, yet Odette remained unfazed, diligently gathering the scattered money. Suddenly his large hand enveloping her shoulder, she could feel the warmth of the fireplace, enough to make the cold slip from her mind.

   “Better to cry, Odette. Kneel before me and grovel.” He spat the command at her, a hint of dominance in his words.

   “Why?” Odette turned to Bastian, “I already paid my debts the way you wanted me too, right?”

   “Debt?” Bastian questioned.

   Not wanting Bastian to see how she was starting to flush, turned away from Bastian, but Bastian took hold of her chin and turned her back to him, their eyes locked.

   Odette was seized by a surge of overwhelming anger, like a tidal wave crashing onto the coast. She threw the crumpled bills in Bastian’s face and with all her might, she fought him off, but he didn’t back down, not even when her flailing hands slapped him around the face.

   Odette felt the world tilt, strong arms wrapped around her and then the sudden crash into the floor. Odette gasped for breath, finding herself on top of Bastian, who had collapsed onto the floor. It hurt and as she looked at him, her eyes filled with a silent scream 

‘I hope you hurt as much as I do.’

At the very moment she acknowledged her first and last desire for this man, the world flipped once again.

   Bastian gripped her chin and yanked her in for a kiss, his tongues wrapping around hers and took her breath away. She tried to cry out, but was muffled against his mouth. She scratched at him, slapped him, pulled his platinum hair-which resembled a light that could never be reached. 

   His hot breath consumed her cold emptiness. There was no escape.



Bastian was the first to wake up. He quickly realised he had fallen asleep on the floor, a soft warmth pressed against him, it was Odette. They were laid together in front of the fireplace, which had died down to glowing embers.

   Gingerly, Bastian rose, trying his best not to wake Odette and put on his robe. He then very carefully picked up Odette. The woman had been quite robust when they first met, but now it felt like she was wasting away with each passing day.

   After laying her on the bed, Bastian went to the bathroom to get cleaned up. By the time he returned to the bedroom, towel wrapped around his waist, the dawn light took a firm hold of the day, bathing the room in a clear, blue light.

   As he looked down at Odette, he was overcome with a profound sense of emptiness. Even as his love had transformed to resentment, this beautiful woman still remained, like a curse.

   Bastian composed himself and set about getting himself ready for the day. He noticed a fresh bruise formed on his cheek when he looked in the mirror to shave. With shaving cream in hand, he gently touched the wound Odette gave him. Fresh memories came in flashes, of the faded allure of the woman, which brought bittersweet disgust to his mind.

   Once he had gotten himself ready for the hunting party, Bastian made his way downstairs, requesting to use the phone from one of the servants he crossed, who then showed him to the drawing room. Bastian waited with the receiver to his ear for the familiar voice.

   “Hello?” the familiar voice said.

   “This is Bastian, the mission has changed.”

Chapter 125.
The sky, where birds the bird fly.




“Lunch is prepared, madam,” the Duke's butler announced.

   Norma Catharina von Herhardt nodded with a smile. She looked around at her assembly with a cheerful countenance as the quiet hum of conversation came to a gradual end at the announcement of lunch. Odette had barely noticed, still staring absently at the tea cup in her hand.

   “Well then, shall we progress to our seats?” Duchess Norma said, signalling for everyone to make their way to the luncheon table. She was paying an unusual amount of attention to Odette.

   Understanding, Odette gently placed her tea cup on the table and went to escort the Herhardt’s dowager. It was rather unusual for Odette to play this role, normally it would be left to the highest ranking guest. This gesture was an attempt to not alienate the unfamiliar woman.

   The ladies made their way to the dining room, with Norma and Odette leading the way. As they strolled down the lengthy hallways, with majestic tall windows on both sides, they caught sight of the sprawling estate belonging to the esteemed Duke. Its beauty was comparable to a heavenly paradise that unfurled before their eyes. Meanwhile, men gathered in their groups, all donning in the dusty browns of their hunting attire moving towards the forest behind the garden.

   Odette could easily spot Bastian. He was engaged in conversation with Duke Herhardt. His distinctive, upright posture and restrained movements were constant, even on horseback. Odette got flashes of the night before, where they had exploded against each other. It felt like a dream.

   “Mrs Klauswitz can’t seem to take her eyes off her husband,” a teasing voice broke through Odette’s daydream.

   Startled back to reality, Odette turned to face Norma, who’s laughter carried a hint of playfulness.

   “Even after three years of marriage, don’t you think it's about time you woke up from the honeymoon? It's quite fascinating.”

   “They did spend two years apart, they must be deeply affectionate for one another.”

   “This must be the best time in the relationship, what with having no kids and all,” a middle aged woman was prompted to say. A chuckle rippled through the crowd of ladies. Odette lowered her eyes, trying to hide the shy smile.

   “Indeed, and come to think of it, shouldn’t Matthias hurry and get himself a nice wife like Odette, he’s missing out on such happiness,” Elysee von Herhardt lamented, watching her son depart. The conversation seamlessly changed towards the upcoming marriage of Duke Herhardt, slated to take place in the coming year.

   With a sigh, Odette turned her attention back to the sunny corridor they were walking down, pondering her exit plan. A blast from a distant horn drew her attention back outside, to the hunting party, who were now at the edge of the wood. Though the distance made it difficult to make out the faces of the riders, Odette could still easily identify Bastian.

   From their first meeting to the present day, memories raced through Odette across the bleak winter landscape. Their relationship had been a matter of convenience, holding hands in mutual benefit. How quickly they had turned to devouring each other and if it continued any longer, the scars were going to be deep. 

It was time to bring things to an end.

After carefully considering her thoughts, Odette made her way into the dining room. Taking her seat, she indulged in casual conversation with the fellow guests. As the meeting drew to a close, she contemplated the opportune moment to take her leave.

However, just as the full course was served, an unforeseen incident unfolded before her eyes. A whiff of oysters reached her nose, causing her stomach to churn in discomfort.

   “Are you alright, Mrs Klauswitz?” the wife of a Judge said, as she sat next to Odette.

   Odette nodded as she covered her mouth with napkin, doing her best to fight down the nausea creeping through her stomach.

   “Oh, my dear, is something wrong with your health?” Elysee said.

   “I am so very sorry, it's only gastritis,” Odette said, swallowing uneasily.

   “I don’t think so,” Elysee said with a strange smile on her lips. “Maybe it's best for you to lie down in the guest room for a bit. I will send someone to fetch Major Klauswitz for you…”

   “No, Duchess!” Odette said, a little more snappy than she intended. “I do not wish to cause such trouble, especially when it's something so minor. With your permission, I think I will return to the hotel.”

   “Alone, without your husband?” Norma said, she looked puzzled.

   “Please, it's bad enough to have caused a scene here, I do not wish to upset my husband's day also. I would just like to return to the hotel discreetly.” Odette appealed to the ladies' sense of honour. A plea that could not be ignored.



Duke Herhardt was the first to bag a prey, his bullet swiftly ending the life of a deer that was racing through the under-brush.

   “Are you also interested in chasing games now?” Riette von Lindman quipped with a clap. Matthias didn’t respond immediately as he swung the head of the horse around.

   Bastian maintained a respectful distance, listening in more than engaging. The gathering had been arranged by Riette, the Duke’s distant cousin. Matthias himself had no love for hunting and was using the gathering as a means to network his business and work out potential partners. Bastian also had no great interest in hunting but  he had been awaiting an opportunity to converse with the Duke, and now seemed to be the perfect time.

   When Riette had caught a rabbit, the hunting party became more animated, with the beaters leading the dogs down near the river, where there would be a better chance for a duck shot. The calm forest quickly became disturbed with the sounds of bearing hooves and gunshots.

   Bastian had been patient, only aiming for what he knew he could hit and one such target was a white waterfowl. Just as Bastian was about to take the shot, he noticed that Matthias was also aiming at the same target. Bastian yielded the prey, only for the Duke to miss. He wondered if the Duke missed on purpose.

   “Wow, look at that, Duke Herhardt actually missed, what an entertaining day,” Riette remarked, causing the other men to laugh. On the other hand, Matthias just smiled.

Bastian lifted his gaze and watched the birds soaring across the sky. Although it piqued his interest as to why Duke Herhardt, a prodigy when it came to shooting, would choose to miss, he decided it was an unnecessary question.

   Just then, a girl came bounding out of the forest, running toward them from the other side of the road.

   “Wait, why is she here?” Riette said in surprise. As an uninvited guest made her way towards the hunting grounds, all eyes, including those of the servants and other companions, turned towards her.

   Bastian observed that little girl with a suspicious glare. She seemed to be one of the servants of the Herhardt’s family, and despite the beaters trying to coral the girl away, she ignored them and approached Duke Herhardt. Bastian decided that the girl was of no concern to him and turned his attention back to the hunt. Matthias tried to steer the conversation and attention away from the girl, while the beaters handled her.

   “Over in the forested area over there are where the deer usually can be found,” Matthias said and the hunting party started to move off in that direction. The winds began to stir, ushering in a fleeting moment of calmness that made everyone to draw closer together.

Above, the vast expanse of a cloudless, azure sky served as a serene backdrop. Bastian’s gaze turned slowly, until he met Matthias's eyes, creating an unspoken connection between them.

   “Major Klauswitz.”

 Unexpectedly hearing his own name, Bastian quickly redirected his attention towards the person who had called it, fully engaged once again.

   “Yes, your grace?”

   Matthias gestured for Bastian to come over and pay attention to the conversation. The atmosphere shifted as every thought it was their duty to also listen in.

   Bastian stood side by side with Duke Herhardt, at the back of the hunting party, the others seeing that there was nothing they could gleam from eavesdropping, raced off to the woods were the deer were reported to be.

"Ah, of course."  Bastian replied with a polite smile

After that, the conversation, momentarily paused, resumed as Riette kickstarted a light-hearted discussion. Soon, the forest was filled with the lively chatter of the hunting party members.

Bastian found himself alongside Matthias, both of them leisurely riding their horses at the rear of the group as others galloped ahead into the thick of the forest. Seizing the opportunity, Bastian and Matthias continued their prior discussion in the peaceful, unhurried setting.

Chapter 126.
The Hand Holding the Fire.



Odette looked up at the clock, 3:42 is read and she quickened her pace across the square. Even though her breath was heavy and she could taste the metallic tang of fear rising to her lips, she couldn’t stop.

   Leaving the Duke’s residence earlier than planned left her with enough time to get to the station on time. Though she was concerned about being caught eavesdropping, it was irrelevant now, that world was no longer her concern.

   “Its okay Meg, we’ll be okay,” she comforted the whimpering dog as they raced up the steps to Carlsbar Central Station.

   After returning to the hotel in the car leant to her by the Duchess, Odette checked for the girl Molly, who, as expected, had left, hiding the treasure Odette had given her.

   With that last loose end resolved, Odette left the hotel once she left the divorce letter for Bastian. The boat that Tira was on should have set sail long before now and all Odette had to do now was make the train on time.

   Just a little more and she would be free.

   Odette pushed herself a little more, iwas hard trying to carry a puppy and drag her luggage at the same time, but the anxiety of having her freedom so close spurred her on.

   Navigating her way through the throngs of people flowing here and there, Odette practically had to fight her way to the ticket booth. With the ticket bought, it wasn’t until she got to the platform where the train was waiting, that she realised that Bastian owned the very train line she was set to escape on.

   “Watch out!” a man pushing a luggage trolley shouted out as Odette made to board the train.

   Odette jumped out of the way, only to put herself directly in the path of another imminent accident. Pushed by the surging crowd moving around the luggage trolley, Odette lost the grip of her trunk. She tried to catch it, but bumped into someone as she bent over, threatening to send her sprawling to the ground. Fortunately, a man behind her offered her support and prevented her from hitting the concrete ground.

   “Are you alright?” the man said, helping by picking up Odette’s trunk. Despite the large scar on his cheek, the man was very cordial.

   “Yes, thank you, I’m very grateful for your assistance.”

   Odette pulled herself onto the train and slumped into the corner, panting. A shrill whistle blasted across the station and the shunting carriages started to jostle forward.

  Finally, 4 o’clock on the dot.



He saw it neatly placed on the side table under the window.

   Bastian immediately walked across the room and picked up the letter with his name stylised across the front of it. As he stared at his name, the sun setting past the window, darkness descended not only on the land, but in him too.

   He received the news that Odette was not been feeling well from that servant girl charging through the hunt like a lost sheep. There was a hint that Odette might be suffering morning sickness from falling pregnant, though she had claimed it was gastritis.

   Being the polite and honourable family, the Duchess had lent Odette a car with which to take her back to the hotel. She even offered Bastian the use of their family doctor, having him sent to the hotel if needed. Bastian suspected there was more to it than that.

   Odette had ran away.

   Bastian knew it even before he opened the door of the empty suite. The precious dog was missing also. The hotel stewards were unaware that the Lady Odette had returned early or even left with her luggage. The maid Odette had brought was also missing.

   Bastian glared at the envelope in his hands, the swirling script of his name across its front. The darkness in the room deepened as the sun set and his mood became black.

   A knock at the door brought him back to reality. It was an urgent knock and when Bastian opened the door, the steward stood before him, he had gone in search of Odette.

   “I have just gotten back from talking to the staff at Ardenne Mansion, they have not heard from Lady Odette or her maid.”

   “I see,” Bastian murmured dryly. 

   He looked over at the dog bed, his eyes coming into focus. It was strange to have brought that dog all the way out here, a clear sign that something was amiss and had he not been so clouded in his thoughts when it came to Odette, he might have sensed something was off.

   “My Lord, is there anything else?”

   “No, you may withdraw now, I will handle my wife,” Bastian said, pulling a cigarette and lighting it.

   “But, my Lord…”

   “There is no need to worry,” Bastian said confidently, as if there was only one truth to the situation. The steward have a curt bow and left, closing the door behind him.

   Bastian didn’t move from the centre of the entrance hall. Standing as if a royal guard on duty, puffing on his cigarette and staring at his name on the envelope. By the time he lit his third cigarette, the hallway was completely dark.

   He eventually worked up the motivation to move himself to the bedroom, where the dim firelight lit the room in a dull golden glow. He sat on the edge of the bed and tore the envelope open.

   Firstly, I want to express how sorry I am for breaking things up like this.

   Odette’s letter began dryly, like a bank notice. Bastian read through the letter slowly, taking in every word and pausing at the end of each sentence to take a draw on his cigarette.

   I tried to atone for you by fulfilling my remaining responsibilities, but it seems that it was nothing more than cowardly self-deception. My greed for a good end even after everything has already gone wrong has finally brought about the worst end of ruining each other.

 Even now, I think the only way to rectify the mistake is to terminate this contract as soon as possible. Even so, it is not right to run away like this, but please understand that I have made an irresponsible decision because it is the best for all of us.

The maid who came with me was Theodora Klauswitz’s maid’s niece of one of the maids who acts like a spy. Through the child she communicated with them. Since she left, she no longer served as her spy, but I withheld her disposal for fear that if I ousted the maid, she would attach someone else to her. I'm sorry I unintentionally deceived you once again.

I clean up the maid myself and leave. There was no suspicious movement from your father’s family. Both me and her were abandoned victims, so the information may be inaccurate, but at least to the best of my knowledge it was.

Attached are the papers for divorce and a letter apologizing to His Majesty the Emperor for my sins. I promise to humbly accept whatever the official grounds for divorce are. Please handle it in a way that minimizes your losses.

I’m sorry we end up with a different contract than the original one.


I will fulfil my responsibility by living quietly outside of your world.

   Bastian stared at the letter, its elegant handwriting a contrast to the content. As he slowly turned over to the last page, he found a note addressed to the Emperor and divorce papers. From crippling her father, to spying for his family and now the drama of her escape, it was a memorandum of sins written in detail, as if she had gone mad with the guilt of it all and wanted to die at the hands of the Emperor.

   Bastian checked the time. He knew she wouldn’t just obey, but he never thought she would do something this crazy. At least, not so stupid as to disregard the risks.

   Why?

   Bastian walked over to the fireplace, sifting through all the memories he had with her. The action of throwing the letters and the divorce papers felt understated.

   “Family,” Bastian muttered, coming to the one conclusion that made sense to him.

   When it came to family, Odette was very reckless and prone to foolishness. Her father had already died and her half sister left her to start her own family. That left only one possibility, just as he came to the conclusion, there was a rap at the door.

   Making sure the papers in the fireplace had burnt away to ash, he went to answer. When he opened the door, there was a member of staff accompanied by a young boy toting a grubby brown bag. He looked at them quizzically.

   “This child has brought a letter for Major Klauswitz, with strict instructions that it should only be received by you,” the hotel steward said, the boy held out a slip of roughly folded paper.

   Bastian nodded, “okay.” Bastian took out his wallet and handed over a small bill to the boy. His face lit up as he exchanged the piece of folded paper for the bank note.

   Bastian didn’t hear the boy say thank you or the hotel staff bid Bastian a good day. He was transfixed on the letter and as he opened it up, he saw that the name he was waiting for.

It was from Keller, the detective that had been following Odette for the last two years.

Chapter 127.
Fanatic and Devotee.


Keller looked over the incomprehensible order and shook his head. As he let out a frustrated sigh, the waiter looked at him as if he was the cause of Keller’s ire. It had been five days already and he was quite familiar with the waiter.

   “Good Morning,” Keller said in his best Feliain, doing his best to put the waiter at ease. He was not anywhere near fluent in the language, but he knew enough to pass polite conversation.

   The waiter smiled and left after placing his order on the table, a simple sandwich that Keller ate with gusto, looking across from the cafe to the Inn that Odette Klauswitz was staying at.

   He had suspected Bastian was losing it a little, becoming a little too paranoid when he instructed him to keep an eye on his wife, when his wife was rarely ever without Bastian. He was relieved a little when Bastian changed the order to follow the Becker couple, leading up to their wedding and following them across the sea.

   At the last minute, just as Keller was having his luggage loaded onto the emigration ship, he received yet another letter from Bastian, changing the order once again to follow Odette in Carlsbar. Keller’s suspicions the old war hero was losing his mind rekindled, but were dashed once more when he caught on that Odette was making a run for it to Felia.

   It appeared that Bastian had predicted his wife fleeing abroad months ago, but why? Not that it was his business to ask such questions. All he needed to do was watch and report.

   Keller was used to meeting with paranoid husbands and wives, suspecting their partners of cheating, but Keller couldn’t make sense of this assignment, but he paid well and the job was easy enough, Odette wasn’t exactly versed in subterfuge.

   He barely even knew Bastian, though they had met some twenty years ago during Carl Illis’s work. They had barely passed a handful of words after exchanging polite greetings. When Carl Illis passed away, Keller never even saw Bastian again, until two years ago.

   Right before Bastian left for the North Sea, he came by Keller’s detective agency and requested him to keep tabs on his wife. It was work Keller did most frequently, but was surprised that Bastian came to him. Word was that Bastian and Odette were the closest couple in the land and loved each other very much.

The labyrinth of his thoughts grew more intricate as he pondered Bastian's motivations. Throughout his career as a detective he honed skills to read people—however, Bastian Klauswitz's intentions eluded him completely. 

Unlike a simple arrest directive, Bastian only asked him to monitor and trail Odette. He also couldn't understand why Bastian let his wife to endure hardship while on the run.

   Time passed on and there was still no sign of Odette emerging from the Inn. He was two coffees down and needed to move on or risk being found out. Just as he was settling the bill, a woman with a white dog finally emerged from the Inn.

   Odette looked up and down the street cautiously, then hurried off toward the busiest end of the road. She wasn’t carrying any luggage, so no doubt she wasn’t planning on going far, maybe even just out to walk the dog. 

Even if he can't understand it, a mission was a mission. Keller lifted his coat's collar, veiling his scarred visage, and began following her.



“What on earth were you thinking?” Maria Gross, Bastian’s aunt, asked. “And with the amount of trouble the Emperor has on you. You really are the black sheep of the family,” she tutted.

   Bastian calmly put down his tea cup and looked at Maria with a gentle smile. “As I said, Odette is just taking a short break.”

   “I know you, Bastian, you can’t fool me. Such a disappointment.” Maria stared at Bastian, her eyes scolding through him.

  Bastian’s wife had run away and that their perfect little marriage was in shambles. Rumors originating from Carlsbar reached the capital in a matter of three days. As it passed from person to person, from group to group, the rumours became exaggerated and wild. Accusations about Bastian mistreating his wife began to circulate.

Rumors originating from Carlsbar reached the capital in a matter of three days.  He simply watched everything in silence, living his daily life. Those who had regarded Bastian as a problem were pleased to witness his reputation  crumbled.

   “At least tell me the truth, what really happened? What sort of contingencies do you have? What’s your plan to get her back?”

   “I think I have explained myself enough.”

   “Well I don’t think so, I confirmed that there had been no travel plans, and that Odette just up and left to visit Carlsbar with you and return, its something we all knew, so don’t try and change the story now.” Maria was determined to squeeze out the truth from her nephew and showed no signs of ever backing down.

   Bastian let out a frustrated sigh and poured himself out another cup of tea, while he steeped in deep thought. If his aunt was this suspicious, maybe she had an insider, maybe a butler or a maid or even a very talkative chef.

   A smile played over his lips as he thought about who his aunt's spy might be. He knew that attempting to impose any restrictions on his aunt would not work and only serve to deepen her suspicions.

   “It was a spontaneous decision. After her fathers funeral and her sister moving away after the wedding, Odette needed some time to herself, for the sake of her own health. I suggested a trip out to the country and she readily agreed.”

   “If that was really the case, then why has she vanished so suddenly and so silently? Like stowing away in the middle of the night. It would have done with much fanfare, that’s just your way, showing off to the world how much you love her.”

   “That was two years ago, I’ve calmed down significantly since then.”

   Maria’s eyes flickers with sadness. “Well, not to me you haven’t, you haven’t changed at all.”

   It was only because she trusted her nephew so much that she agreed to the marriage in the first place. He was a man that would never let himself get swept up in emotions and make mistakes, but to see him so blinded by foolish love.

   “You need to put an end to this. The period promised by the Emperor has passed and there is no use in keeping that scarecrow hanging around, causing all this unnecessary drama.” Maria issued Bastian a stern command.

   It wasn’t about business any more, as even without the marriage alliance, they were strong enough to stand against Jeff Klauswitz. It was Bastian’s crowning achievement, so there was no reason to keep Odette hanging around. If Maria had thought for a moment that Odette felt for Bastian the same as Bastian felt for Odette, she would have blessed their marriage long ago.

   “You need to arrange for a divorce before the year is out. Odette is responsible for all this scandal, so the Emperor won't have a leg to stand on. If you’re clear on who is responsible, we can suppress baseless rumours.”

   “I will handle it in accordance with what I judge probable. Don’t worry, it won't interfere with my official duties.”

   “For heaven's sake, Bastian, do you think I am pursuing this out of some petty act of revenge?” Maria turned red with anger.

   Bastian shook his head with a smile. “Absolutely not. I understand your concern for me. I’m just saying that you don’t need to worry.” Bastian drew the line in the sand with a polite tone, but his eyes on his aunt were like ice.

At times like this, he's just like his father. 

Maria could see the fanaticism of desire in Bastian, he was half Klauswitz after all and just like Jeff Klauswitz, who went wild with greed at the prospects of marrying the daughter of a successful junk dealer, then became intoxicated with the honour that the daughter of an aristocrat would bring, which only led to the tragedy of today.

The Klauswitz family's desire was short-lived, akin to a brief spark. While it burned intensely for a while, it was not sustainable over time.

Maria didn’t want that fate for Bastian, who was also an Illis. She looked at her nephew with pensive eyes.

   Carl Illis was the antipode of Jeff Klauswitz. He lived his life dedicated to a single purpose. That driven tenacity was what made him so successful as a junk dealer, but that one track mind was also poison and led to the death of his daughter, who had allowed herself to become blinded by love.

   The fanatic and the devotee. Could two qualities in direct opposition to one another exist in one man?

   “Odette would return soon and when she does, I will let her know that you wish to see her.” With a gentle expression on his face, Bastian got up and bid farewell to Maria. The light in his eyes resembled the desire of Klauswitz and the determination of Illis.

   “Bastian,” Maria called out impulsively, making Bastian stop just as he reached the door. “Don’t forget, you still have debts left to pay to your grandfather.”

Maria was aware that her advice would add another shackle to a child who had shouldered responsibility from a young age. At least it's better than ending up like his mother.

Bastian exited the reception room, his nonchalant smile on display and his gait reflecting a military discipline. In the meantime, Maria had a deep wish for Odette not to reappear. This situation, according to her, would be the most beneficial for both parties. Because she thought, it was the best choice for both of them.

Chapter 128.


First Taste of Freedom.



Bastian woke in the blue dawn of a new day. It was the time in the morning when all that was hidden by the night would be revealed in the new light. He didn’t need to check the clock, keeping time was something all soldiers could do well.

   Rubbing his dry, sleep addled face, Bastian roused from the bed. He poured himself a glass of water and mechanically went about his usual morning routine.  As he stood in the cool shower, water streaming over his face, he found himself thinking about Odette. It had become part of his normal routine a long time ago. 

She had fled to Felia.

   Bastian went through the details of the report as he washed his face. He had a premonition that something was amiss when he watched Odette fall asleep the day before she ran away. He never dreamed she would be capable of such deceit, but she was a determined woman, a kindred spirit almost. After suffering yet another defeat, maybe it was time he admitted she was a step above him.

   He initially suspected that she would attempt to run away with her sister. To his surprise, Odette boarded a train to Felia, alone. Almost alone, she had taken that irritating mutt with her and a travel bag. He suspected that she had not gathered as much money as she would have liked, staying at a cheap Inn in the middle of the city.

   He should have brought her back immediately, to save all this commotion, but he had decided to hold off for now. He needed to find a way to bring her back without too much hassle, besides, he had Keller keeping an eye on her, so there was no rush.

   Bastian decided to skip breakfast as he dressed, settling instead for a cup of coffee with a spoon of sugar. His butler would always look at him disapprovingly, but over time, came to accept this decision.

   “Sir, about the membership screening of the Ratz Opera Theatre,” Lovis said, having chosen the right moment to bring it up. “I received a message from Admiral Demel, he has said that it will be difficult to pass.”

   Bastian nodded calmly, while Lovis looked deeply concerned. The Ratz Opera Theatre was infamous for its strict membership intake. To obtain membership, more than half of the board had to approve. This was not Bastian’s first time being refused.

   Bastian thought he had better odds this time, with his connection to Admiral Demel, but it seemed like this was not enough and Bastian couldn’t help wondering if it was because of the whole Odette situation.

   “I do not mean to pry, sir, but would it not be beneficial to bring Madam home as soon as possible and clear up all this mess?” Lovis offered his advice with caution. Bastian did not say anything and only smiled.

   It was all part of the challenge in acquiring all the memberships he could, of all the influential social clubs. He had no real interest in the Opera and without Odette by his side, he doubted he would ever actually intend to visit.

   “Admiral Demel has advised to contact Count Xanders,” said Lovis, just as Bastian was about to leave. “He is the most influential member of the committee. If you were to gain his support, your membership could be a done deal.”

   “I understand, thank you Lovis, I will discuss the situation with the admiral at the admiralty.”

   With the barest nod, Bastian left Lovis behind. Beyond the windows of the hallway, Bastian could see the Ardenne Sea, spread out and glittering in shades of blue and green, creating a delicate turquoise hue.

   Bastian sincerely hoped that Odette was keeping well. This could be an opportunity for her to recover her health. It wouldn’t hurt to let her take this time for herself and ensure the healthy growth of the child she bore.



Overtime, Odette was able to expand her living area as she became more confident that no one was looking for her. At first, she cautiously moved about the Inn, then the area immediately around the inn and now, she happily, but cautiously, ventured to the city centre.

   She stopped by a grocery store to get an apple and then went on to take Margrethe to the park. It had become a favourite place during her exile to Felia. Despite the changing season that withered the flowers and left the trees bare, it was a pleasant, sunny afternoon.

   “No, Meg,” said Odette, pulling the dog in close to her.

   Margrethe was desperate to play with the ducks in the pond, but Odette kept the dog on a short leash. She hadn’t fully recovered her stamina yet and tired out easily, but she was feeling much better since leaving Berg.

   It had taken a while, she shut herself away in her room at the Inn, keeping the curtains closed and the room dark, like the den of a hibernating animal. She slept for long hours, completely forgetting the passage of time and only ventured out of the room to reluctantly get something to eat.

   After three days of being shut away, Odette thought it time to open the curtains again and let in the warm light. After another couple days, Odette finally plucked up the courage to step outside. It helped to have Margrethe with her.

   Taking off her gloves, Odette rubbed her tummy, it helped to have this child with her also. Despite all the hardships, it was proving to be quite resilient. It was yet to make its presence known, but soon enough there would be a bump that would swell like Tira’s belly. By the longest days of summer, she would be cradling it in her arms.

   While thinking about that day, Odette realised she had naturally come to terms with facing a future with a child. Bastian had been right, this child was her family and she couldn’t bear the thought of ever abandoning it. Even when coming to terms with the fact that the child might resemble Bastian the most.

   No matter who the child resembled or how it was conceived, it was still her child, her family. With strengthened resolve, Odette felt determination in the face of raising the child, alone if she must.

   “Hello,” said a man as Odette was planning to move on. “Would you give me the honour of escorting such a beautiful young lady on a walk around the park?”

   “Oh, I would love to, but I am waiting for my husband.”

   Odette lied calmly. The man quickly backed away when Margrethe started to growl and as Odette held the dog back, trying to calm her, the man saw the wedding ring on Odette’s finger.

   “Ah, well, I see, sorry for the intrusion,” the man said quickly and retreated before Odette lost her grip on Margrethe.

   The wedding ring had been completely forgotten about. It was worth more than any of the trinkets Odette sold before, but couldn’t risk selling that for fear of raising Bastian’s suspicions. Now that she was free of him, she should sell it at the first opportunity.

   The news of Major Klauswitz’s marital troubles should be public news by now, with the sudden disappearance of his wife. With any luck, the divorce papers will already have been submitted. If she had the inclination, Odette might be able to find news of what’s happening, but for now, she still needed to be careful.

   Odette put on her gloves and moved off. She had enough money to live off for now, so postponing selling the ring might be a good idea. It would be easier to move around without the piles of money the ring would bring. She would keep it for now and sell it when she needs to.

   She had wanted to walk around the park some more, but the man that had propositioned her was lingering nearby and she didn’t want to get caught out in the lie. He unnerved her a little. She decided that she would walk the streets near the Inn, before returning to her room.

   Once returned, she opened the window to let in some fresh air, shook out the bedding and tidied up a little. Not that there was much mess.

   Once satisfied that things were neat and tidy, Odette shared the apple with Margrethe. It wasn’t a fruit she was particularly fond of, but recently she had a craving for it. Perhaps it was something the child in her belly wanted to try.

   Once the apple was devoured and the juices cleaned from fingers, Odette stretched out on the bed and allowed herself to nap. When she woke again, the sky was already darkening.

   Leaning on the window, to look out at the brilliant orange of the sunset, Odette took in the scenery. The sound of the bells from the cathedral rang out over the city. It was a scene that reminded her of her childhood in Felia.

   After the banishment order came through, her family set up in Felia. Odette was born and grew up here and when she was fourteen, the Emperor changed his permission for their entry into Berg. Felia had always felt like home to her and since this was familiar ground, she felt she could establish strong roots here.

   Raising a child alone was going to be tough, but she felt like she had the resolve to manage everything alone, even the birth. It couldn’t be any harder than when she had to raise her sister and look after a father who was constantly blind drunk.

   Now, in her own world, she could finally live for herself. Looking up at the sky, where the first signs of stars were starting to twinkle, Odette got her first taste of freedom.

Chapter 129.


Shall we continue?



The mood of the party quickly shifted when Bastian Klauswitz made an appearance. Quickly, the news that had been spreading across the city, spread through the guests in the banquet hall. By the time Admiral Demel and his wife had finished greeting all the new arrivals, everyone's attention was turned to Bastian, the Count Maximin Xanders included.

   “I’m surprised he didn’t make an excuse not to come,” some at the party were saying.

   “Well, he’s a shameless man, there’s nothing surprising about it.”

   “Even so, isn’t it a bit much to be showing his face at a party, while rumours of his wife running off spread? I think it strange Marchioness Demel invited him in the first place, the grandson of a junk dealer, what was she thinking?”

   Maximin sighed pensively. It was an uncomfortable conversation to listen to, but it was hard to ignore when it was on everyone’s lips. There was no way to escape it.

   “Did he really abuse his own wife, the Emperor's niece? I thought they were well known for having a loving relationship.”

   “I think it strange he would cherish her like a lover. Bloodline aside, she’s practically a commoner. I feel he married her just to protect himself from Princess Isabelle.”

   “You may be right, it was strange that he would go off for two years without her, and not even so much as come back for a quick visit.”

   “Well, I heard that it was her fault,” one guest said, speaking of Odette. “While her husband was away, she played around a bit, you know? And ended up conceiving a child with another man.”

   Bastian moved around the flood of conversation, feigning ignorance of the gossip which died away before him like the wake of a ship. He conversed with important naval figures, minor nobles and even members of the royal family, as if it was just another party to maintain his network of relations. There was no sign of any concern for his wife.

   Maximin excused himself from the conversation, not able to withstand another second of degenerate speculations, it flowed on without pause. His own feelings on the matter were hard enough to comprehend.

   “Hello, Sir Xanders.” A low tone reached Maximin’s ears as he reached for his drink. He knew instantly who it was.

   “It's been awhile, Major Klauswitz,” said Maximin, as politely as he could manage.

   They stood a short distance apart, a quiet no man’s land between them. Bastian stood as an imposing figure before Maximin, he couldn’t tell if he was doing it on purpose or just his military bearing. There were many well built and sturdy naval officers at the party but Bastian stood out amongst them.

   What if this man really did abuse Odette?

   Maximin hadn’t realised the rumour had taken root in his mind. His mood darkened significantly. Bastian continued on a conversation as if he didn’t notice and skilfully led the conversation through subjects of no importance and recent events. Stock market values, sporting events and something about the weather.

   They spoke as perfect gentlemen to each other. Without any prior information about his lineage, no one would have guessed that Bastian was a commoner. Maximin kept his eye on him, who spoke in a short and consistent manner. He looked rather tired, maybe long nights spent awake, worrying about Odette or he could just be overworked. Without any other tells, Maximin couldn’t distinguish.

   “How is Mrs Klauswitz doing?” Maximin decided to take charge of the conversation.

   Bastian looked away as if he didn’t hear the question, choosing instead to pass a greeting between someone across the hall. Maximin had provoked Bastian and he felt a sense of satisfaction at unbalancing the man, if only briefly.

   In reality, Bastian had been studying Count Xanders, looking for any signs that he had anything to do with Odette’s escape. Satisfied that the Count did in fact have nothing to do with it, he moved on, satisfied that he had successfully confronted Count Maximin von Xanders.

   He had wanted to bring up the topic of membership, but that could wait for the opera house, and even without Count Xanders help, he could acquire it another way.

   “You never answered my question,” said Maximin, stopping Bastian from walking away by placing a hand on his shoulder.

   “I don’t see why I have any obligation to convey my wife’s well being to you,” said Bastian, brushing the hand away, but Maximin didn’t back down.

   “She’s not just your wife, she’s my friend too.”

   “Ah, your friend.”

   “I understand that she is in a very vulnerable spot and not in good health,” said Maximin, probing for an answer.

   “So?”

   “I’m simply saying that it is normal for someone to worry about a friend, who’s out travelling alone and in such poor health,” Maximin said in a scolding tone as if admonishing a child.

   “I know it perfectly well,” Bastian said with a bark of laughter. He looked at the count with an amused smile. “I wonder, are you the father of the child she carries?”

   “Major Klauswitz?” Maximin flushed bright red.

   “I’m kidding.” Bastian shrugged as if it was no big deal. “I lost myself in the moment there, I didn’t mean to be impolite. I promise, there was no ill intent. Please understand.”

   Bastian returned to his imposing, upright posture and offered Count Xanders an apology. Maximin was silent for a moment. It was an admonition disguised as an apology, as if to tell Maximin that he had crossed the line first.

   “Have a pleasant evening Count Xanders.” With that, Bastian offered the smallest bow and walked away.

   Maximin turned and walked out onto the balcony of the banquet hall. Only when he felt the chilly breeze did he take a breath, as if not wanting to inhale the toxic miasma in the hall.

   Bastian’s remarks had been impertinent beyond any measure, yet there was some validity to them. Maximin knew that his interference had crossed a line, and yet despite that, he couldn’t stop himself.

   Why am I behaving so foolishly?

   He could have spent all night trying to untangle that incredibly complicated knot of thought.

   Maximin looked up at the deep, dark sky over the garden. Regrets niggled at his thoughts. Regret that he didn’t get to say goodbye to Odette. Regret that he didn’t do more to help her. He couldn’t help but think that it was his fault.

   Maximin stayed out on the balcony, alone, until his flushed cheeks cooled and he could face going back into the hall, where Bastian had humiliated him.



“Shall we continue?” Noah said in a low whisper.

   Sandrine turned away from the window that looked out over Ratz, bathed in the gloom of night. She looked over the dinning table, at Noah past its lavish centre piece, he wore a smile like a child ready to play a prank.

   “I mean, the exhibition. So, I heard that Mrs Klauswitz has run away, so would it not be pointless to display that painting?” Noah sighed, the smile fading a little.

   Sandrine remained silent, tilting her glass toward her mouth as she stared out at nothing, thinking. Her look was intense, like the night they had snuck into Franz’s studio.

   She desperately wanted to display the painting at the exhibit, telling everyone that she thought it was a crime to keep such a masterpiece out of sight. She told Noah to prepare it for a friend and if all went well, they could arrange for official sponsorship from the House of Laviere. It was far more reliable than a dowry.

   The idea was insane and Noah knew it, but how could he refuse? Franz wouldn’t be able to continue on as a painter, given the strife at his house and if later he got married, and his wife’s family intervened, a young and fragile noble like Franz would not be able to budge.

   Would Franz be able to sponsor young painters any more, should that day come? Noah made up his mind the moment he found the answer to Sandrine’s question, which struck him like a dagger. Rather than risk being abandoned, Noah would turn his back first.

   “What about the next exhibition?” Noah suggested with caution, fearing that Sandrine might be set to change her mind.

   “No, there’s no need,” Sandrine said firmly, putting down her glass.

   If Odette had genuinely ran off on her own accord, then there was no point in trying to humiliate her. If Bastian didn’t cut ties with her now, he was going to suffer a lot of loss. His only course of action was to finally divorce that woman.

   There was no way Bastian wasn’t aware of this fact. He was a cold, calculating man, he knew when to cut ties and which to strengthen. It had been a month already and the shock of him still holding onto Odette was unbearable.

   Bastian refused to let go of Odette and his reputation was taking a pounding for it, he was no longer seen as the brave war hero that nearly lost his life, but the sad husband who had lost his wife.

   Sandrine wanted to ask him why he was holding on so stubbornly, but feared the answer, for then there would be no turning back. It was better to endure in ignorance, than risk collapsing that bridge for good.

   “So, does that mean we are cancelling the plans?” Noah said gloomily.

   Sandrine raised her head and exhaled slowly, smoke billowed up toward the ceiling and she bit down on her cigarette holder.

   She needed to do something that would utterly ruin Odette, destroy any chance of her being able to come back to Bastian. He would inevitably get burned by whatever Sandrine had planned, but it would be worth it to get him all to herself. Anything would be better than being with a fake wife.

   “No, we continue as planned.” Sandrine brushed away the ashes.

    Is it because she still loves Bastian Klauswitz

   Sandrine mulled over this question multiple times without arriving at a conclusion. However, one fact stood out: she refused to accept          her love ending like this.

   That sole reason enough to explain why she couldn't stop.

Chapter 130.


Expensive Face.



Odette moved into her third accommodation, a quiet boarding house in a quiet residential area, run by a very strict landlady.

   After unpacking her small amount of belongings, she sat on the edge of the bed to catch her breath. The room was on the top floor and looked out northwards.

   The fireplace fended off the cold, bitter night. Odette didn’t really care where she was, only that she was in a nice, warm, cosy place. Although she had put in a lot of effort to secure this cosy little spot.

   The landlady was very sceptical when Odette told her that she was a lady from a fallen noble house and she was looking to make a fresh start some where new. The landlady quizzed Odette ceaselessly and wasn’t satisfied until she had gotten Odette to play the piano in front of her, to confirm that Odette was a piano teacher.

   “It’s quite fortunate, isn’t it?” Odette said to Margrethe. She had developed a habit of talking to her dog since being alone.

   Margrethe was sniffing around the room, inspecting every corner of the room, when she came bounding over to Odette, putting her slobbering muzzle onto her lap. Seeing those endearing eyes look up at her made Odette laugh. Any time things seemed bleak, moments like this made her smile.

   It had been a month already, since Odette escaped Bastian and none of the things she feared the most had come to pass. While Odette sought some form of stability, the child in her grew. The passage of the peaceful days made her worries of the past a distant memory.

   Odette stroked Margrethe as she turned her mind to the future. She could winter here, but giving the landladies strictness, she doubted she would be able to stay here with a child and no father. Odette wanted to get a rental house, but in order to do that, she needed a way to make money.

Deep in thought, Odette looked at her fingertips. The landlady seemed to enjoy Odette's piano playing and may be able to help her in finding a part-time teaching job. Initially, she planned to lay low and avoid trouble, but due to dwindling finances, she could no longer remain hidden.

   She would ask at dinner if there were any jobs available. Satisfied with her plans, Odette got up and finished her unpacking.

As winter was nearing its end, Odette ignited the fire to combat the cold. Her financial condition dictated minimal use of firewood, forcing her to only light the fireplace post-sundown. The past two years had been unlike the norm, abuzz with a luxury that was not truly hers. Presently, she has returned to her baseline circumstance— a scenario not unfamiliar to her as, since childhood, she faced winters of scarcity.

   “Sorry for putting you through this, Meg.”

   Odette was over come with guilt as she looked at Margrethe, who had curled herself up in front of the fireplace. For the dogs sake, Odette needed to familiarise herself with the local geography.

   By the time Odette had finished getting herself settled into the room, the bell for dinner rang out. Odette hastily tidied herself up in front of the grimy mirror. Her belly protruded a little and she did her best to try and hide it under the drape of her dress. She had come to notice her body was going through a lot of changes recently. The thought that she will need new clothes was growing louder with each day. She needed to find a job.

Wrapping a large shawl around her changing body, Odette stepped out of the room with steady strides.



“Good work Franz, you did it,” Jeff Klauswitz said, showing affection and pride that he had never shown before.

   Franz stared at his father blankly, unsure of how to react. The report was still on his fathers lap, torn up and almost forgotten as they pulled into Boulevard Preves.

   “So, have I helped in matters?”

   “Ha, you’ve done more than help, son, to say that you’ve only helped would be extremely modest indeed.” Jeff smiled broadly as he patted his son’s shoulder.

   On the surface, it looked like a simple war for the throne of king of the railway, but just under that was a complex hive of companies competing for high stakes. The Klauswitz Railway Company was structured so that where ever the railway company went, a dozen other companies followed. Bastian had mimicked this strategy to the point where it was impossible to tell the difference between the rivals.

   Two years ago, when the railway company had tried to cheat with a diamond and failed, they used a strategy to infiltrate at the base level so that they could shake up the top. This was only possible thanks to the growth of Illis corporation, which rivalled Klauswitz.

   Things were set up so that if the railway company was to collapse, than the shipping and steel industries would collapse too, starting off a chain reaction that would ruin everybody. That way, the company was practically invulnerable to attack.

   Bastian was concentrating on setting up a strong link between Felia and Belov. Using an aggressive strategy that made it seem like he was being reckless, too much confidence was going to create weaknesses.

   These weaknesses Franz exploited expertly, managing to swipe away the deal from Bastian with pinpoint precision. Franz had a clear advantage after sabotaging Bastian’s attempts to secure the funds he needed.  More over, the financial minister of Felia, who were spearheading the contracts, was a close friend to the Count Klein family. No matter how cunning Bastian tried to be, he was going to find it almost impossible to close the gap.

   “This bid might be just the thing you need to kick start your era,” Jeff Klauswitz said, adopting the air of a proper businessman.

   The car stopped in front of Ratz Central Station. The two stepped out of the car and the onlookers recognised Jeff Klauswitz as the King of the Railway.

   In two days time, the victor of this little war would be announced officially and by the time they returned from Felia, no one would dare utter baseless rumours of Bastian Klauswitz dethroning his father.

   “Oh, father,” Franz said, his mood darkening.

   Out from the crowd, a tall military officer strode toward them with determination. A face that could be recognised at a glance. Bastian.



  Bastian broke the silence first. “It’s been awhile, father, how have you been?”

   Jeff Klauswitz stared at his son like he wanted to murder him, but he didn’t raise his voice. He suppressed the anger burning up his insides and greeted Bastian politely. It looked like any formal family reunion.

   “Will you be heading to Felia to personally oversee the bidding? You’re very much more proactive than I thought you would be.”

   “Yes, well, I assume you are doing the same.”

   “Of course, since Felia is an ally of Berg. I anticipate this will only solidify our friendship.”

   “Would it be wise to sell your face so openly?” Jeff was running out of patience, but Bastian smiled care freely and shrugged.

   “It's a face that sells for a pretty high price.”

   “Like you said, you’re quite famous in Felia, I guess rumours of this has already spread that far, but, would it be wise to entrust such an important appointment to a young, inexperienced upstart that can’t even keep control of his own wife?”

   “We will have to wait and see how things unfold.”

   “Yes, we will,” Jeff Klauswitz said, calling Bastian’s bluff.

   Jeff and Franz strode away confident in their victory and looked as if they were royalty inspecting their kingdom.

   No one really noticed the passage of the Klauswitz men, they were all too busy with the hum drum of their own lives. Crowds of people moved about the station like clouds in the sky. Forming currents and eddies of living souls going about their business.

   Bastian moved with the crows toward the platform and although he was going to the same place as his father and brother, he lost sight of them pretty quickly. Things should quiet down a little without those two bothering him.

   Bastian didn’t delay and headed straight for his first class cabin. As soon as he reached the carriage, a team of servants that had been waiting for him sprang into action.

   “There’s no need for ostentation,” Bastian said, “lets just get on with it.”

   Bastian was accompanied by Thomas Muller and together, they poured over every detail of the meeting that was coming at the other end of the train tracks. By the time they were happy with minutes of the meetings, the world outside was dark.

   “We’ve worked hard, lets get some rest before moving on,” Thomas said, stretching.

   Bastian smiled as he watched Thomas work out the aches in his back from leaning over the all too small desk piled high with folders, folios, dossiers and loose bits of paper.

   “That certainly sounds like a good idea,” said Bastian, doing his best to prevent a yawn.

   Thomas switched off the cabin light, leaving the only source coming from a tiny bedside lamp.

   “I’m glad you agree and don’t even think about looking at another official document until the morning, got it?”

   “Yes, of course,” Bastian said, feeling like a child.

   “If I catch you doing more work and not getting the much needed rest, I will be very disappointed in you,” Thomas said. He repeated his threats serval times before finally exiting the cabin.

   Bastian kicked off his shoes and laid out on the bed which was slightly too short for his tall frame.

   He had requested leave from the admiralty to go on this business trip, but not for the reason he gave them.

   Odette was staying at a cheap lodge and was looking for a job. Even after all the jewels he had given her, how comfortable and easy he had made her life, she would prefer to go out and buy firewood when ever she could afford to, according to the latest report from Keller.

   Throwing off his tie, Bastian looked out of the small window, to the moonlight sky that twinkled with a hundred specks of diamonds.

   When he calculated his loss from Odette, he couldn’t help but laugh in the face of such silly behaviour. All the talk of selling face, hers was probably the most expensive.

   That kind of trouble was worth a reputation being dragged through the mud.
