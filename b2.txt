Chapter 53.
Ordinary Family.


Duke Dyssen, with an air of anger, asked once more, "Did the letter not arrive?" seemingly forgetting that he had already been given the same answer on multiple occasions.

The caregiver politely responded with restraint, "I can assure you, Your Grace, that no letter was delivered to you."

The Duke had always babbled nonsense when he first awoke, but lately his condition had gotten worse. The caretaker was really concerned that he might need to be admitted to a mental health ward.

"There must be some mistake. Please go down and check it again. And this time, make sure to check thoroughly." Dyssen insisted,

"I understand your concern, but I've already checked three times - yesterday and the two days prior."

 The caregiver's voice, trying to soothe Dyssen, was tinged with irritation that couldn't be concealed. Although he was a Duke, a member of the nobility convalescing in a high-end hospital, the truth was that he was nothing more than an abandoned invalid. 

At first, he even raged at his daughter for her absence, but it didn't take long for him to reconsider. He realized that his daughter had already shown immense strength and fortitude simply by staying in his life, even after cutting ties with him.

"Did they have the audacity to ignore me, knowing who I am?" The Duke's anger made him tremble as he shouted.

The cycle repeated itself once again.

The caregiver, struggling to find the right words, tiptoed back into the room, considering a swift exit before the Duke erupted in fury. If only she could manage to sedate him and put him to sleep, she could make it through another day without incident.

"Tira, that foolish girl, could never have come up with this on her own. It's clear that Odette convinced her to do it - 'let's get rid of father and live happily ever after.' They intended to kill me. If I had fallen any harder, I would have died on the spot." His words turned into sobs, causing the caregiver to freeze in shock.

"He destroyed Odette," the Duke continued, his anger boiling over. "It's all because of that despicable man. What kind of hero is he? He's the devil who ruined my life just so he could marry Odette!" With that, he began to strike at his crippled leg.

Realizing that the Duke couldn't be left in his current state, the caregiver pressed the call button and requested the assistance of the medical staff. Within a short while, a doctor arrived, accompanied by a group of burly guards.

"Release me! Bring my daughter to me immediately! Bring me Odette!" 

Duke Dyssen thrashed about, even as the guards pinned him down. His struggles continued unabated, fueled by a monstrous strength that belied his frail and withered body. 

The caregiver retreated to the safety of a corner, observing the chaos, frightened. The Duke frantically searched for his daughter, until he was subdued with a sedative and slipped into unconsciousness. This was a different kind of rage than what she had witnessed in the past - not simply a pessimism regarding his personal situation, but a fierce and consuming anger that threatened to consume everything in its path.

As she listened to the Duke's ravings, the caregiver found herself contemplating the unthinkable – Could it really be his daughter? Had his daughter truly been the cause of his madness? It was a dangerous thought, and one that she knew she couldn't trust blindly, especially coming from a man who was half-mad himself.

The sedative took effect quickly, and soon the Duke was sound asleep. The medical staff departed, leaving behind an uncanny silence engulfing the room.

As she cleaned up the Duke's room, the caregiver let out a frustrated sigh. "I can't keep doing this every day," she muttered to herself. "It's like a never-ending war."

She surveyed the damage caused by the Duke's latest outburst - broken fixtures and furniture strewn about the room - and resigned herself to the fact that it would all need to be replaced, thanks to the deep pockets of the despised son-in-law, Bastian. It was a luxury the Duke enjoyed, even as he raged against the man who provided for him. 

Despite the Duke's persisting anger towards his son-in-law and daughter, the caregiver couldn't help but feel suspicious. As she exited the room, her exhausted body was plagued with an overwhelming sense of curiosity.

Although there was still an hour before the next caregiver was scheduled to take over, she contemplated leaving early to ensure she wouldn't be late for lunch. After all, the Duke would be sleeping all day, so she saw no harm in finishing her shift a bit earlier.

Yes. Patients who are overcome with despair and melancholy must have a special sense of victimization. The caretaker fought all the way to the city center on the train, but she was only able to get to that conclusion.

Working for the Duke was a precarious situation, but the high salary made it hard to pass up. It was best to tread carefully and avoid getting involved in his personal issues, as there was little to gain and much to lose by doing so.

As the train pulled into the center of Ratz, she realized she had arrived at her destination. With a clear mind, she stepped off the train, feeling much more at ease. Suddenly, she heard her name being called.

“Susan!” Looking up, she saw her sister standing at the nearby bus stop, and a wide smile spread across her face.



"Seems like I was needlessly concerned. Captain Klauswitz's party went off without a hitch." 

Countess Trier smiled at Odette. The breathtaking coastal landscape of Ardene may have been the star of the show, but it was Odette, the hostess of the grand mansion, who added the perfect touch of elegance and sophistication. 

Every detail of the luncheon, from the exquisitely arranged table that blended in with the sea-facing garden to the seasonal menu that tantalized the taste buds of the guests, and even the seating plan that took into account the social status and bonds between them, was executed flawlessly. Truly, it was an exquisitely beautiful affair.

"You've transformed into a whole different person in just one season. You're a fine lady, I suppose it's not too much to say." Countess Trier exclaimed. The cries of seagulls flying low over the water mixed with the compliment. "I imagine you've already forgotten how I used to call the Countess every day and bug her since I didn't know anything," she said. 

Odette smiled softly as she regarded the sandy shore. As the warm sun beat down on the beach, the guests scattered in different directions to enjoy the afternoon activities. 

The adventurous ones headed out to sea on sleek yachts, slicing through the waves with the wind in their hair. Others opted to lounge on the sandy shores, soaking up the sun's rays and dipping their toes in the refreshing water. For those looking for a bit of exercise, a stroll along the beach offered stunning views of the sparkling ocean and towering cliffs in the distance. It was a perfect afternoon of leisure and excitement for all.

Countess Trier lauded Odette's achievement with just a few words of advice, hailing it as a talent deserving of praise. She emphasized that one couldn't fabricate or hide their bloodline, and that Odette's innate abilities were proof of her royal heritage. In a confident tone, she expressed her belief that if lineage was the sole determining factor, then surely Odette should have inherited more from her father.

With a disillusioned question on her mind, Odette chose to respect the grateful old lady's wishes by refraining from contradicting her. She didn't want to spoil such a beautiful day by bringing up her father. Additionally, there was a significant reason why she wasn't prepared to contemplate her father yet - she had forsaken him for Tira.

Even though Odette didn't look back on the decision she made that day, she couldn't shake the remorse and debt she carried in her heart. Perhaps she would have to live the rest of her life carrying a debt from her heart. It was the agony of Odette.

Countess Trier let out a disapproving click of her tongue and set down her half-empty champagne glass, urging Odette to leave the table of mostly elderly guests sitting under the white awning. She believed it was a waste of time for a young lady as lovely as Odette to engage in conversations with such dull and uninteresting people.

As the Countess Trier was about to speak, a young man appeared, but Odette interrupted her by shaking her head "No. I like it here." She gazed out at the picturesque sandy beach, enjoying the view.

Countess Trier cast a concerned look at Maxime, who arrived carrying his daughter in his arms. "I doubt your daughter will ever learn to walk on her own, Count Xanders," she commented with a furrowed brow. 

Maxime responded calmly with a smile, "She's still a baby. Please don't be too hard on her." He then took the empty seat beside Odette.

Countess Trier stepped back, her face displaying disapproval. She did so since she was fully aware of how much Maximin loved and cared for his wife. It was also true that he had given his daughter all of the love that had wandered off course.

As Maxime and Odette strolled through the garden, Maxime deeply noticed the impressive landscaping. After taking a moment to admire it, he glanced over at Odette and brought up a fitting topic of conversation.

"It's really lovely here," Maxime commented. "The attention to detail is impressive."

"Yes, it's all thanks to Lord Xanders' advice. I know it's getting late, but I still want to thank you again for all of your help. Thank you for the recommendation." Odette said gratefully.

Maxime shook his head modestly. "You're welcome, but I must give credit where credit is due. Mrs. Klauswitz actually found the right answer."

As the two of them exchanged pleasantries, Countess Trier observed them closely. She left amazed at how she noticed the striking similarities between them. They had a quiet and refined presence about them that gave off an aura of elegance. Upon closer inspection, she realized they even had similar personalities and interests. It was as if they were brother and sister.

The thought crossed her mind of how lovely it would be for Odette to have a partner as charming as Maxime. However, she quickly dismissed the notion as nonsensical and unwarranted.

"Oh, it looks like your husband is returning," Countess Trier remarked, using her fan to gesture towards the sea.

As Odette played with Count Xanders' daughter, she heard the sound of a yacht slicing through the brilliantly sparkling water. She turned her head slowly towards the direction of the boat, curious to see who it might be.

To her surprise, she recognized the familiar golden initials engraved on the side of the yacht –K

 It was Bastian's ship.



Observing the crowd of guests, Bastian noticed a young couple with a small child who appeared to be just like any ordinary family. It was a rare sight among the attendees at the event.

With that thought in mind, Bastian made his way towards the beach awning. His fellow officers who had disembarked with him followed suit. It was time for them to take a break, relax, and spend some quality time with their loved ones before heading back into the mansion.

A fireworks show would round off the dinner and festivities. It was all that remained after the incident. Bastian was confident that it would be ideal as well. It was his wife's belief in him that gave him the confidence.

Odette did a good job as the hostess.

He no longer appeared to question that reality. The woman had transformed into a socialite in a matter of months from being little more than a target of sympathy and hate until last spring. As if that were the way things always happened. She resembled a queen who had led a magnificent life all of her life.

Bastian had a fondness for the coronation he had purchased with his own funds. He believed that if the world hadn't bestowed it upon him, he would have found a way to acquire it himself. There was something alluring about wearing a sparkling crown and ruling from a magnificent golden throne, no matter the cost.

"Bastian," Odette's voice interrupted his thoughts.

As Bastian searched for Odette among the crowd, he became increasingly perplexed by her absence. However, just as he was beginning to worry, he heard a familiar voice.

Turning his head, Bastian saw the family he had passed earlier. The woman who had been seated with a child in her arms was now standing, accompanied by the man who had been sitting next to her.

Bastian's lips curved into a smile when he recognized the couple as Odette and Maxime, whom he had previously assumed were married.

"Captain Klauswitz, did you enjoy the voyage?" Maxime was the first to break the silence. Bastian turned towards the voice, his expression stoic and composed. Despite exchanging formal pleasantries, his senses remained fixated on Odette, who was cradling someone else's child with great care.

The tense atmosphere dissipated when the child was abruptly taken from Odette's arms and returned to Maxime's care, ending the delicate confrontation.

"Mommy!" The child's voice rang out suddenly, calling out to Odette.

As Bastian wrapped his arm around his wife's waist,  the Count's daughter began to cry uncontrollably. Maxime and Odette were taken aback by the sudden outburst, their faces flushing with embarrassment. The other guests seated around the table shared a similar reaction.

Despite the awkwardness of the situation, the child continued to sob, calling out to Odette as "mom" repeatedly and with increasing desperation. Her cries were so loud and piercing that they echoed across the sandy beach.


Chapter 54.
An Affair.

"Did the letter not arrive?"

Duke Dyssen, with an air of anger, asked once more, seemingly forgetting that he had already been given the same answer on multiple occasions.

The caregiver politely responded with restraint, "I can assure you, Your Grace, that no letter was delivered to you."

The Duke had always babbled nonsense when he first awoke, but lately his condition had gotten worse. The caretaker was really concerned that he might need to be admitted to a mental health ward.

"There must be some mistake. Please go down and check it again. And this time, make sure to check thoroughly." Dyssen insisted,

"I understand your concern, but I've already checked three times - yesterday and the two days prior."

 The caregiver's voice, trying to soothe Dyssen, was tinged with irritation that couldn't be concealed. Although he was a Duke, a member of the nobility convalescing in a high-end hospital, the truth was that he was nothing more than an abandoned invalid.

"Release me! Bring my daughter to me immediately! Bring me Odette!" 

Duke Dyssen thrashed about, even as the guards pinned him down. His struggles continued unabated, fueled by a monstrous strength that belied his frail and withered body. 

The caregiver retreated to the safety of a corner, observing the chaos, frightened. The Duke frantically searched for his daughter, until he was subdued with a sedative and slipped into unconsciousness. This was a different kind of rage than what she had witnessed in the past - not simply a pessimism regarding his personal situation, but a fierce and consuming anger that threatened to consume everything in its path.

The sedative took effect quickly, and soon the Duke was sound asleep. The medical staff departed, leaving behind an uncanny silence engulfing the room.

Despite the awkwardness of the situation, the child continued to sob, calling out to Odette as "mom" repeatedly and with increasing desperation. Her cries were so loud and piercing that they echoed across the sandy beach

"She's been missing her mother terribly," the Countess spoke up, deftly diffusing the awkward tension that had settled over the group.

"Yes, she's envious of the other children who have mothers.” Another woman, who had been observing the scene with growing unease, added her own comment. “Alma has taken a liking to Odette, you see."

Meanwhile, Maxime carried his inconsolable daughter away from the scene. As they retreated to the other side of the sandy beach, Alma continued to twist her neck and cry out for Odette.

"Please forgive me, Captain Klauswitz," Maxime apologized, feeling the weight of the situation on his shoulders. "It was just a child's mistake."

“Yes. It’s all right.”  It was a rather unpleasant situation, but fortunately Bastian gave a cool smile. “Sometimes kids get the wrong idea, Maxime’s late wife resembles my wife a lot.”

Just as the situation was finally resolved, Admiral Demel emerged from somewhere. Countess Trier's eyes narrowed as she shot him a glare. Her head started pounding again when she saw his carefree expression, as if he was completely unaware of the impact of his words.

"Isn't it true?” Admiral Demel continued to speak, despite the tense atmosphere, “They may have different heights, but their resemblance is striking. It's no wonder Alma mistook Odette for her mother." He laughed loudly, seemingly pleased with himself for contributing to the conversation. "And speaking of resemblance, Alma looks just like her mother. Yes, that's it. So, in a way, Odette and Alma do look like mother and daughter..."

"Please, have a taste of this." The Marchioness Demel hurriedly presented a plate of cake, leaving the Admiral bewildered. Despite the unexpected gesture, he took the plate from her and obediently sampled the cake.

Finally, Countess Trier let out a sigh of relief. The military man, whose common sense had obviously been submerged in the imperial sea, was now calmly devouring the fruitcake.

"When are you two going to start a family?"  Countess Trier playfully remarked. Bastian shifted his gaze from Maxime and his daughter, and Odette's cheeks flushed slightly. "You adore children so much, Odette. Imagine the love you'll have for your own."

Odette was presented with a cleverly laid-out subject, but for some reason, she hesitated to respond. Was it due to shyness? Countess Trier began to feel perplexed when unexpectedly, a bystander came to their aid. It was the antique dealer's grandson, who had been observing the situation.

Bastian gave Odette's back a gentle stroke, "I have no doubt that Odette will be an amazing mother, full of love for her children." He then placed a firm grip on her shoulders and continued, "I hope to have a daughter who takes after her mother. Do you not feel the same, my love?" 

The Count's daughter's tears finally ceased, and a white butterfly fluttered into the awning where the commotion had taken place, lazily exploring the surroundings.

Odette replied calmly after moistening her lips with cold water, "I don't believe it would make any difference." Despite her still-tense posture, her smile was flawlessly smooth and graced her glossy red lips.

As the Klauswitz couple's first child became the topic of discussion among the guests, opinions were tossed back and forth. Some suggested it would be a son, while others insisted it would be a daughter. The debate continued as to which parent the child should resemble. Despite the heated conversation, Bastian remained fixed on Odette, his gaze never leaving her.

A child.

It was a concept that had never truly crossed his mind. If he had to assign it some significance, it was merely an additional factor that came with the decision to marry. If he was fortunate, he would have a worthy successor, but if not, it didn't concern him much. His focus was solely on attaining his objective, and passing on his heritage held no appeal for him.

Bastian knew that the idea of having a child with Odette was off-limits, as it could cause problems in their relationship. He had learned from his father's mistakes and knew the importance of avoiding discord. 

Sandrine, on the other hand, was the woman he felt was deserving of bearing his child if he ever decided to have one. The thought of a child being born from Odette's body was something he had long dismissed.

Maxime, who had given his crying child to the nanny, apologized again, "Alma made a big mistake. I am sorry, Captain Klauswitz, and Mrs. Klauswitz." Bastian smiled at him and reassured him, "It's all right, Lord Xanders. I understand." He knew that this was the response everyone was hoping for.



The serene ambiance of the night sea was suddenly disrupted by an earth-shattering roar that could not be ignored.

 Intrigued by the commotion, Jeff Klauswitz made his way to the bedroom balcony, determined to uncover the source of the tumult. As he gazed out, a breathtaking spectacle unfolded before his eyes - a dazzling fireworks show that illuminated the grand mansion standing majestically across the bay. It appeared as though the raucous revelry was drawing to a close.

"Why are you hooked on that?" A voice full of anxiety asked from behind. Theodora had just entered the room, and she fixed her curious look on the person speaking.

As Jeff Klauswitz gave a cheerful response, his eyes remained transfixed on the night sky, captivated by the fireworks display. "Somehow, I felt compelled to have a closer look,"

 With a heavy sigh, Theodora joined him on the balcony, standing by his side. "He must be feeling ecstatic at the moment. It probably feels like he's firing shells right at us," 

"I would prefer that."

 "What do you mean by that?"  Theodora asked.

"Dealing with someone who has emotions would be a simpler task." Jeff chuckled cynically and approached the railing, taking a step closer.

Realizing the situation could escalate, he decided to intervene before things got out of hand. He had to put a stop to it before the situation spiraled any further.

Ever since Bastian bared his claws, Jeff had been racking his brains to find a way to fortify himself. However, the deeper he delved into the inner workings of Bastian's schemes, the more despondent his gaze became. A sense of inadequacy and helplessness overwhelmed him, as he contemplated the overwhelming outcomes that seemed inevitable.

He had been following Bastian's lead based on the hard-earned facts, but it didn't seem as easy for him to change the course of events as he had assumed. He may have to continue to live in this way for a while.

"I meant, Theodora, that if Bastian was bent on vengeance, he would target me. However, I never imagined it would be in this manner," Jeff explained, shaking his head in disbelief. As he did so, a sudden burst of fury surged within him.

It was clear that Bastian had no interest in their possessions. His temperament already showed that he would assault with the determination to destroy everything.

As he became aware of Bastian's sinister designs, a twinge of regret crept into Jeff Klauswitz's consciousness. He couldn't help but wonder if abandoning his child would have been the better choice.

With each passing moment, the remorse within him grew more profound, particularly when he considered the fragility of little Franz.

"Bastian is your son. Don't do this, please. Huh?"

As he spoke, memories of Sophia kneeling with her pregnant belly and offering prayers emerged, overshadowing the beautiful fireworks that adorned the night sky.

Taking care of the child he had fathered was the right thing to do, Jeff acknowledged. He had no intention of causing harm to Sophia, despite their complicated past.

In order to safeguard his family from financial ruin, Jeff had wed the daughter of a moneylender. The Klauswitz family was in dire need of Illis' financial resources at that time. Yet, despite the pragmatic reasons behind their union, Jeff had grown to genuinely love his wife. She was a gentle and stunningly beautiful woman who cherished him deeply. How could any man resist such a woman?

Jeff Klauswitz had once entertained the idea of spending his entire life with Sophia. If he had never crossed paths with Theodora, perhaps that fantasy would have become reality. If only Sophia had agreed to a divorce, she might still be alive today.

 The memory of his deceased wife, with their unborn child inside her, made him feel nauseous. The putrid stench of her blood and amniotic fluid seemed to linger in his nostrils, haunting him.

With blood and amniotic fluid surrounding him, the newborn Bastian did not cry. Instead, he stared at Jeff Klauswitz with an unsettling calmness from behind a partially open door.

 Jeff couldn't shake the feeling of disgust at the child's appearance, which seemed more like that of an adult than a newborn. Theodora claimed that Bastian was not a normal child, and this encounter only reinforced Jeff's unease.

He was initially hesitant, but eventually came to accept it. After all, Franz was born as the perfect son, receiving the noble blood of his mother. To ensure that Franz would be the rightful heir, Bastian had to be deemed abnormal.

"Don't be weak. In times like these,” Theodora's frown deepened as she firmly grasped Jeff's hand, “ you must steel yourself."

“I am aware, dear.” Jeff Klauswitz acknowledged Theodora's statement with a nod, accepting that there was no way to undo the past. He was left with only one option, to demonstrate that his choices were justifiable. As he attempted to clear his thoughts and turn around, a knock interrupted him.

"Excuse me, ma'am. I am Susan," spoke the maid who had gone on a vacation earlier this morning, deduced Jeff as he heard the knock on the door.



The night sky was illuminated with a grand display of vibrant fireworks, a spectacle of lights that was only reserved for official events. With awe and excitement in her eyes, Odette watched as the bursts of colors painted the sky, creating a surreal atmosphere.

 The fireworks seemed to bloom even in the sea, reflecting the stunning display in the waters below. It was a breathtaking sight that was almost too beautiful to believe.

As the last firework exploded in a burst of colors, she wondered if the party could be considered a success. She sensed Bastian's approach and felt a surge of cautious anticipation. 

The two stood together at the end of the terrace, fingers tightly intertwined, watching the display of lights in the sky. It felt natural for Bastian to hold her hand, and they both seemed lost in the beauty of the moment.

Bastian's side profile caught her attention as she slowly moved her head. She didn't want to sound patronizing. As Mrs. Klauswitz for the life of the contract, it was her responsibility to perform successfully. She was doing what she was meant to do, but it made her feel uncomfortable, which was sort of amusing.

The palms were firmly pushed together as the heat spread between them. She tried her hardest in memory of the days spent preparing for today.

As her emotions stirred like a burst of fireworks, Bastian's gaze slowly turned towards her. The way he looked at Odette was calm yet gentle, like a cool breeze on a summer night that signaled the arrival of autumn.

"How is everything going?" Bastian asked. The final firework burst in the sky, leaving Odette puzzled and confused by his cryptic question. "I believe my wife's infidelity is more than enough reason for the divorce you were concerned about," he continued, implying that he suspected Odette was having an affair with Maxime

The Ardene Bay was bathed in a cascade of golden fireworks, its brilliance illuminating the night sky. And yet, despite the beauty of the scene, Bastian's words pierced her heart like a knife. With a gentle voice, as if whispering sweet nothings, he shattered her illusions of love.

It was a cruel realization, but one that she could not deny.


Chapter 55.
Habits.



The first rays of the morning sun peeked through the window, casting a warm glow over the room. Bastian stirred awake and sat up, taking in the peaceful atmosphere of the early morning. 

He glanced over at Odette, still lost in her dreams. Her nightgown had slipped down, exposing the delicate curve of her neck.

His eyes travelled down her long, delicate neck and straight collarbone before stopping on her calmly rising and falling chest. It was obscured by the tilted blanket and nightgown, but it wasn't hard to guess what was underneath.

Bastian turned away from Odette and quickly got out of bed. The scene in the play where they summon a maid to witness their passionate exchange was left out. Due to the fact that the break was finished. The moment has come to head back to the Admiralty.

Bastian retraced his steps to his bedroom via the adjoining passage. As he stepped into the bathroom and turned on the shower, the first light of dawn was barely visible in the sky.

After satisfying his moderate desire, he finished his shower. It was a routine activity that required no conscious effort or willpower, similar to shaving, brushing hair, or putting on a uniform.

“Do you really want such a scandal?”

Odette's measured question entered his head just as he was about to press the final button on his jacket.

Odette didn't start speaking until the fireworks display was over; she had been gazing at Bastian in silence for a while. Even the slightest hint of perplexity was gone, leaving only peace on her face. He gave a head nod in understanding.

A naive yearning to discover the noble woman's actual emotions or a cheap curiosity about her profundity. It was a horrible feeling, either way.

"Fine. If that's your desire." 

Odette's acquiescence was laced with disdain as she replied. Her response to Bastian's earlier proposal was equally blunt,

 "I'll find a suitable partner when the time comes." 

Bastian chuckled dryly as he finished fastening his last button. She didn't even know how to kiss properly, so how could she imitate a promiscuous woman?

Even if it wasn't in the same vein, it was difficult to write it off as foolishness.

With a single glance, Odette could attract enough scandalous men to fill her ten fingers, if she so desired. She had no need for any seductive tactics, as her natural allure was enough.

Bastian finished preparing for the day, adjusting the shape of his shoulder straps, before opening his eyes. As he did, the butler entered the room with a cup of hot, strong coffee.

"Considering your long commute to work, it must be difficult for you. Therefore, I have arranged for Hans to assist you," offered Butler Lovis.

Bastian shrugged indifferently and added a handful of sugar to his cup of coffee. It was his usual breakfast routine.

"Please do have a proper meal at least. I would hate for you to harm yourself." Lovis persisted.

Bastian set down his empty cup and reached for his hat. "Thank you, Lovis, but I know my own body. There's no need to worry."

Lovis furrowed his brow. "It's hard to believe you'd say that, considering someone in your position who has had to delay their duties due to health problems."

"I suppose a hearty breakfast will protect me from enemy fire?" 

Bastian  made light of the situation, and Lovis could sense the clear boundary he drew. With a heavy sigh, Lovis retreated, and they both knew this was an unspoken understanding that had developed over their years of working together.

Bastian glanced at the clock and strode swiftly out the bedroom. The entry hall of the mansion, which was lined with servants who had come out to see him leave, came into view after travelling through the lengthy corridor and down the central staircase.

In the center, Odette was holding out for him. The hostess' elegant body gained sophistication from the early sunlight streaming in through the big window on the landing. It was difficult to imagine that she had once been a lady who had slept unsecured and unattended.

As he got closer to his wife, Bastian scowled a little. Next, a polite cheek kiss was given, to which Odette reciprocated with a smile. Acting was sufficient to live up to the expectations of those around them.

Bastian’s hand gently brushed the corners of Odette's red eyes. “You don't have to come out tomorrow. There's no need for you to wake up early and go through this kind of formality,” he said in a soft whisper."

“No. As I am unable to sleep in when it is morning, it is not difficult. It is nothing in comparison to the delight of seeing you again." 

Odette's face was showing signs of nervousness, but she kept up her believable behavior. She might be able to obtain a main role at the Royal Theatre by the time of their divorce, given how her abilities were growing every day.

Bastian made the decision to change the subject when he saw Odette's hardened eyes. A lot of eyeballs were everywhere to watch. There was no need to make an effort to instigate pointless conflicts and stir up distrust.

“If there is anything you need, let me know."

Bastian effortlessly arrived at the best answer. He was fairly certain of the type of response that would be given. Odette also stayed inside the planned range.

"You are everything I need." With a countenance that was barely changed from when she said the crazy thing about finding an affair partner if he did, Odette mumbled a lovely fib. Bastian desired a controversy to serve as the catalyst for.

Bastian gave his wonderful wife another kiss as a praise. Her forehead and flushed cheeks were touched by his lips.

Slowly, he moved his lips. Odette jerked her body in surprise, but he moved a little quicker as he securely enveloped her face.

When Lovis's coughing announced the time of departure, which could no longer be delayed, the slow and persistent parting kiss came to an end.

Odette strained to control her breath as Bastian lightly kissed her lips before letting go. Her breath, which came out in a tiny sigh, was sticky with heat. The conclusion was gratifying.

"Let's eat dinner together, please. I'll be back as soon as eight at the latest."  With that pledge, Bastian exited the mansion.

“Bastian!” 

He opened the driver's door just as he heard Odette's urgent call. Bastian observed her from behind him.

"It's not necessary to go over. Although I would like to be there with you, I don't want to be a burden."

Once more, his devoted wife displayed endearing sympathy.

"Don't stress over that. Today is not a hectic day. "With a reaction fit for a husband who cares and loves his wife, Bastian wrapped up the programme.

With a glance at his watch, Bastian swiftly slid into the driver's seat of his car. Although the time was later than anticipated, he aimed to make up for lost time by accelerating as much as he could. 

As he started the car, the line of servants standing in front of the mansion bowed in unison. Bastian returned the gesture with a nod and focused his attention on the center of the crowd. There, standing tall and straight, was Odette, illuminated by the brilliant sunlight.

As Bastian left the estate and stepped on the accelerator, the view behind him quickly disappeared. The fog that had once enveloped the horizon vanished, revealing a bright and clear day with a sea of bright blue-green. 

As he drove along the winding coastal road, his gaze kept returning to the ocean, almost involuntarily, as if his body had a mind of its own.



A puppy with a shaggy coat and a dusty coat suddenly appeared in the woods. 

Odette quickly pulled back on the horse's reins to stop it as she carefully navigated the road. Luckily, the devoted horse obeyed her urgent order instantly, allowing her to quickly dismount. Odette approached the hairy creature, which was standing in the center of the road and waving its tail as if to say hello, her heart pounding.

"I'm curious where you're from. Do you still have your owner?" Odette approached the puppy with caution, asking it a number of questions while sounding worried. The dog began to hop up and down with joy as its eagerness increased. Odette moved closer to the dog when another dog appeared from the surrounding grass.

She was startled and came to a complete stop. Though being dressed in a sloppy, dust- and dirt-covered attire, the dog appeared to be of a good breed. It had long, white fur that reached the ground that was soft and big. A wandering dog could never have given off that look.

"Oh, you are the mother." 

Odette unintentionally let out a long sigh as she stared at the stray dog with the bulging milk. Yet making a casual approach proved challenging. The mother growled ferociously while obstructing the baby's path and bared its teeth.

The suspicious dog didn't relax and kept its guard up despite Odette's soothing gestures and attempts to convey her pleasant intentions. Odette took a couple steps backwards carefully to give the dog some room. She was left wondering where such a strange dog could have come from as the mother dog and her pup disappeared into the woods. 

Odette was trying to figure out what was going on as she stared into the thick woodland where the dogs had disappeared. As far as the eye could see, there were only two mansions in the area, both belonging to the wealthy Klauswitz families. 

Odette and Bastian's mansion was virtually dog-free, so the only possible explanation for the barking that had roused them from their slumber was the family home across the forest, looming ominously in the distance. 

But there was a glimmer of hope: perhaps they could reach out to their neighbors and inquire if they had lost a dog. After all, the two mansions were in close enough proximity to each other that communication was possible.

It had been at least two months since the mother had given birth in the seclusion of the woods, based on the size of the puppy. They most certainly wouldn't have gone that long without communication if the dog's owner had lost track of it. She was forced to ask herself the same question she had been considering from the beginning after coming to this conclusion.

With a heavy sigh, Odette turned around, her heart sinking as she realized that time was running out. There was less than half an hour left for her to indulge in her passion for horseback riding before she was expected to welcome the esteemed guests. If she failed to make a swift exit, she would have to face them in her riding clothes - an unforgivable faux pas that would undoubtedly draw the cold contempt of her husband, Bastian.

The weight of his intense gaze often left her feeling burdened and despondent, a misery she hoped never to endure again. To shake off the overwhelming emotions, she cleared her mind of all extraneous thoughts and feelings before mounting her horse once more.

 Fortunately, with her new riding clothes having arrived just the previous weekend, she was able to clamber onto the horse with greater ease than before.

Odette was grateful for the kind consideration that Bastian had shown her. He had gifted her a magnificent horse that she could ride to her heart's content, along with all the necessary equipment to make the experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. 

Even though she was always conscious of the public eye and the expectations that came with her position, she never took for granted the immense value of the favors bestowed upon her by Bastian.

Despite the pain of his heart-wrenching words, Odette stayed determined to perform to the best of her abilities. 

She gritted her teeth and soldiered on, playing the role of the loving newlywed even as it became more and more challenging with each passing day. Her ultimate goal was to leave a lasting impression on her husband as an employee who had earned every penny of her high salary.

Bastian had suspicions she would eventually have an affair and seek a divorce, yet Odette had other plans in her mind. Once her contract was up, she intended to retreat from the public eye and live a quiet life away from the influence of the royal family and their social circles. 

For now, all she could hope for was to part with Bastian on good terms and bring their complicated relationship to a positive conclusion.

Odette moved her horse in the direction of a shortcut after taking her eyes off the route where the two dogs had vanished. Horse hooves soon started making a loud echoing sound along the overgrown trail.


Chapter 56.
The Light That Waited for Him.



"You know, my father used to work as a blacksmith," As Molly chatted away non-stop, she eventually began to share the story of her family.  "Unfortunately, he was seriously injured in an accident and has been unwell for quite some time now."

Odette glanced at the mirror in front of the dressing table and caught sight of Molly combing her hair. When their eyes met, Molly's shy smile struck a chord with Odette. The young girl's chatty and bubbly personality was just like her younger sister Tira’s. It occurred to Odette that they were probably around the same age.

Mesmerized by the similarities between Molly and her sister, Odette curled her lips into a gentle smile, signaling that she was ready to listen to whatever the young maid had to say.

Molly's eyes sparkled with joy as she delved deeper into her family's history, her voice filled with even more enthusiasm. She spoke mostly about her father, who had been left paralyzed by a tragic accident. It was evident that Molly shared a unique and special bond with him, which made her story all the more heartfelt.

"Madam, I'm sure you must be worried about your father on his sickbed too, right?" As the hair brushing neared its end, Molly posed a bold question to Odette.

"Molly!" Dora's sharp shout interrupted as she worked on Odette's dress, but Molly wasn't easily deterred.

"You haven't been able to visit your father in the hospital since your marriage. How Madam’s heart is must ache," she said, looking at Odette with teary eyes through the mirror.

Odette's heart felt like it was being clawed by a nightmare at the sound of the name "Father", but she hid it behind a composed expression. Instead, she patiently waited for Molly to finish her work, a gentle smile gracing her lips. It was the least she could do for the young maid, who had made a mistake but deserved compassion.

People need to be spaced apart in a reasonable manner. It served as a kind of buffer, guarding against interactions that were based only on position or rank. Because of how that divide contributes to understanding and respect.

"My apologies, madam.” Dora, who had almost shown Molly the door, expressed regret, “Despite her intelligence and competence, it seems that Molly still has room for improvement in terms of etiquette and has made a significant error."

"No worries. She only meant well." With a chuckle, Odette quelled the minor disturbance, assuring everyone

 The clever head maid promptly resumed her tasks, making no further fuss about the incident.

Odette set up her dresser the way she always did as Dora finished the dress. She was able to move through her nightly routine at a more leisurely pace than normal because the man who had been giving her disturbing stares was obviously not around.

"It's likely that the master is lodging at Mr. Mueller's place, so you should get some rest, madam." Dora appeared from behind the dressing table and suggested.

Odette set aside the comb she had been absently playing with and rose from her seat, as if complying to Dora's advice.

Last week, the guy was a model employee - clocking out on time every day to make it home in time for dinner. However, today he had to work late due to some pressing business. Though he hadn't explicitly mentioned it, Dora had a sneaking suspicion that he might not come back home that night, and as the clock neared midnight, her intuition seemed spot on.

The man had a grueling journey ahead of him, and even if he managed to catch some shut-eye, he'd have to be up at the crack of dawn to head back to work.

As Dora was about to leave after briefing Odette about the schedule for the following day, she unexpectedly interjected, "Excuse me, but Mr. Lovis mentioned he had a favor to ask of you. Can I plead his case?"

Odette perched herself on the edge of the bed and turned to face Dora. "Sure, what does he need?"

"He's fretting about the master's breakfast habits," Dora revealed. "To be honest, I share his concerns."

Odette looked puzzled. "Let me get this straight - Mr. Lovis is worried about Bastian's breakfast?"

Bastian Klauswitz was a strapping, affluent young man who had gained fame as a valiant soldier, lauded for his bravery. Odette couldn't fathom why anyone would fret over the eating habits of someone who was already in such excellent shape.

"Yes, madam," Dora replied. "I've been suggesting to the master that he starts his day with a hearty meal instead of just a cup of strong coffee, but he doesn't seem to heed my advice. We were hoping that you could intervene on our behalf and convince him to listen to your wise words since he values your opinion greatly."

 "Uh, sure, I'll try my best," Odette let out an awkward chuckle. She knew that if the stubborn master wouldn't listen to the wise counsel of his trusted butler, there was little chance that he'd take heed of his pretend wife's nagging. But she still agreed to give it a shot.

No matter what she considered, the request was absurd, but Odette first consented. She would just tell him the truth and seek for his help if things got too rough. He never shied away from portraying a perfect relationship, though.

"I'm grateful, ma'am. The master needs you by his side because he doesn't take care of himself very well. " Dora lowered her head in sincere joy. Odette had never seen a face as dazzling as hers.

As soon as Dora left, the bedroom fell into a deeper silence.

Odette moved to the window, wrapped in a warm shawl, and gently pushed back the drapes to reveal the wide expanse of the nighttime, moonless sea. 

The sound of the waves, which had been a comforting relief all summer as she stared out at the desolate waters, appeared to have a hint of sorrow. She questioned whether the beginning of a new season was what had caused this shift.

As the curtains were drawn shut, the reality dawned on Odette that he wouldn't be returning tonight. With a heavy heart, she concluded her daily routine and retreated to bed. But as she switched off the lights and snuggled under the covers, memories of her estranged father came crashing in like a tumultuous wave. 

She knew that eventually, she would have to confront the painful past and pay him a visit. With a deep, melancholic sigh, she clutched her blanket tightly, aware that her despondency would be conspicuous even to the young maid.

Speculation swirled in Odette's mind, leaving her with little confidence to confront her father with composure. Yet she knew that turning a blind eye to him was not a sustainable solution. 

With a heavy heart, she made a vow to write a letter to him the following day, determined to face her demons head-on. As she shut her eyes, she was aware of the bed's emptiness and the cold seeping in, signaling the need to stoke the dying embers of the fire.



As midnight crept closer, the carriages and automobiles that had been queued up in front of Sergeant Illis' building began to vanish, one by one. With only two cars left, Bastian bid farewell to his colleagues and made his exit.

"Join me today," Thomas Mueller gestured towards his car. It was already too late for Bastian to drive back to Ardene, but he declined Thomas' offer without much thought.

Bastian shook his head, "No, I'll head home," 

"It's a long drive back to Ratz, and you won't get much sleep before you have to come back.” Thomas Mueller tried to dissuade Bastian from leaving so late, “ Is it really worth pushing yourself?"

"Well, you know how it is. Gotta keep the new wife happy." 

Thomas smiled awkwardly, unsure of how to respond, "The age-old myth that even heroes can be swayed by the charms of a beautiful woman appears to hold true," Thomas conceded, unable to persuade Bastian any further. "I must admit, I had my fears about the young master marrying the wrong woman and living an unhappy life."

"Don't worry, Sir. Odette is a good person," reassured Bastian.

"Sure, you have my full trust because you say so," Thomas Mueller grinned broadly. Despite the fact that the fatigue from the hard effort was evident, Bastian's face appeared at relaxed. If marriage was the cause of this transformation, Mrs. Klauswitz was a bride who brought a sizable dowry.

"Hey, Young master!" Thomas Mueller couldn't help but shout out as he watched Bastian walking away.

Bastian paused and slowly turned around on the last remaining step.

The word hung in the air like a heavy cloud, shrouding the two men in silence. Thomas could see the ease with which Bastian interacted with Odette, and his heart softened. He wanted Bastian to forget about his revenge, and that's why he made the impulsive call. 

Bastian understood Thomas's intention, but he knew he couldn't let go of his past so easily. With a heavy heart, he uttered a single, dejected word - "No." 

The silence continued for a while longer until Bastian finally broke it with a smile and a bow, before disappearing into the darkness, stepping into a sleek black car waiting for him under a canopy of trees.

The car accelerated swiftly and sped off to the opposite side of the city. Even the last of the elderly woman's pride was destroyed by the landscape.



“Madam had gone to bed”

The butler greeted Bastian with the news to which Bastian responded with a smile and proceeded to cross the entrance hall, not feeling the need to say anything. He knew that it was highly unlikely for Odette to be awake at such a late hour, and the thought of her being up would have only caused him unease.

Bastian acknowledged the servants for their tireless efforts throughout the night and proceeded to his chamber with a serene gait. As he stepped into his room, he realized he wouldn't have to share his bed tonight, a fact that brought a sense of relief. It was at this very moment that the mansion's lights began to shimmer against the shoreline, painting a picturesque view.

As Bastian emerged from the bedroom, his mind still fixated on his decision. He had freshened up and changed, but his resolve remained unshaken. 

He had no intention of disturbing Odette's peaceful slumber; the performance he had put on earlier was enough. But as he stood at the threshold between the two rooms, the absurdity of the situation dawned on him with a jolt. It was almost comical, this image of a man hesitating to enter his own bedroom.

Bastian was a firm believer in the power of routine. It was a way to conserve mental energy and emotions, and the most effective method for living life. However, his conviction was faltering now. He acknowledged the chance of being wrong and hesitated before placing his hand on the doorknob.

Odette had gradually assimilated into his daily routine, but far of making his life simpler, it had made it more complicated. Bastian hesitated as he approached the last door because he knew what was there would only make things more difficult.

For a moment, he watched Odette sleeping peacefully, then returned to his own room. But he quickly realized that there was no reason to have hesitated in the first place.

He was entitled to exercise all of his desired authority. Odette was required to comply and follow. As it was stated in their contract. Her opinions were not taken into account; only his requirements were important.

His thoughts vanished when he consciously reminded himself of that reality.

Bastian moved forward with a purposeful stride, driven by his own requirements. He pushed open the door and made his way through the comfortable space till he came to Odette's bed. His imagination suddenly solidified a fresh demand. On the nightstand to the right of the bed, a lamp illuminated with a glow. 

Bastian's gaze remained fixed on the last remaining light in the room, transfixed by its glow, even as the droplets of water on his wet hair dripped down and re-formed.

 As the grandfather clock chimed the hour, he heard a faint sigh, and his attention turned to the sleeping figure on the bed. He swallowed hard and averted his gaze, but it was too late. In the soft light, Odette stirred and slowly opened her eyes, fixing them on him.

“Bastian”

Odette called him, as soon as her deep sleep got invaded by his arrival.

"You're back,"

She sound like a devoted wife. 


Chapter 57.
 A True Lie.



The prospect of winning seemed rather bleak, but undaunted, Odette gathered her resolve and initiated her daily routine with a composed tap on the door.

"Please enter," Bastian's voice droned from behind the closed door.

Odette didn't hesitate any longer, unlocked the door, and went into Bastian's bedroom despite the fact that she was still carrying a weight that she couldn't seem to get rid of. Soon after, the butler and an attendant carrying a tray with a basic breakfast arrived.

“Odette.” 

Out of the blue, Bastian swiveled around and uttered her name, catching her off guard. Odette had been staring at her balled-up hands and halted her steps involuntarily.

Midway through his outfit transition, Bastian found himself caught off guard. The only attire adorning his figure was a pristine, buttoned-up shirt, while his undergarments and socks lay in plain sight. Taken aback by the unexpected sight, Odette quickly averted her gaze, wishing she had picked a better moment to approach. However, having already made her presence known, she found herself unable to make a graceful exit.

Odette struggled to force her lips open but managed to do so and hurried to the table. The butler moved aside to make room for the maid who was waiting for her turn after placing a kettle of water and coffee on the table. In accordance with her instructions, the spread in front of her included boiled eggs, simple bread, and a variety of grilled fruits and vegetables.

After carefully arranging the cutlery and napkins, Odette took her seat at the table, determined to put on a façade of composure, despite her inner turmoil.

"What is it, madam," Bastian asked, his voice laced with amusement.

“It’s breakfast, as you can as well, see." Odette announced, having steeled herself for the confrontation. She turned her head to face Bastian, only to be greeted by the awkward spectacle of him fastening the hem of his shirt to his thigh garter buckle.

Though flustered by the embarrassing sight, Odette found it difficult to avert her gaze, as there seemed to be no other suitable place to look.

Bastian methodically rolled up his sleeve, adorning his wrist with a gleaming timepiece and a pair of cufflinks. Next in line was his tie, which he tied with practiced ease. Only then did he attend to the long-awaited task of donning his pants.

Meanwhile, the butler tended to Bastian's well-polished footwear, ensuring that they were pristine and free of any blemish.

A deep sigh escaped Odette's lips as she took a proper glance at her husband, Bastian. While he checked the time, he moved towards the mirror to adjust his tie and shirt collar with a practiced hand.

She observed him with a mix of curiosity and wariness, as it was the first time she had seen a man getting ready for the day. She noted the stark contrast in their approaches to dressing up, with men's rituals being markedly different from those of women. The way they handled even the simplest of tasks, such as straightening a collar, seemed to be infused with a certain masculinity that was foreign to her.

Bastian employed harsh lines to draw attention to his body's structure as opposed to her, who concentrated on sculpting the softest curves and wrinkles. He appeared to be smooth and graceful due to this, despite his somewhat higher stature and frame.

Bastian slipped on his uniform jacket after one final inspection of his look. He had barely turned his back and the early morning light was falling on his shoulders. Odette had seen the cop before, and it had the same expression.

"You need not go through all this trouble, my dear Odette. A cup of coffee suffices for me," Bastian said as he made his way towards the table, coming to a halt in front of it. 

Bastian's response was anticipated,but Odette remained unfazed. "Considering the long commute to work, perhaps it's time to shake things up a bit?" 

She had a knack for persuading and nurturing adults, a skill she had honed thanks to her daughter Tira, who had a habit of expressing her concerns in a concise and poignant manner.

Although Tira was a very small and frail child at the time, the core issue remained essentially the same.

Odette flashed a warm, sisterly smile "Why don't we give eggs a try?" She chose to ignore Bastian's incredulous gaze, which seemed to question her sanity. "Did you know that by observing the way the shell cracks, I can predict your fortune for the day?" she added with a hint of playfulness.

Odette ignored Bastian's lack of response and carried on with her work. She started by replacing him with a cup holding a warm egg and a spoon for cracking the shell.

"Come on, Bastian. Let me read your fortune," she urged with a cheerful smile. The morning sun cast a radiant glow on her as she bustled about, tending to various tasks. Bastian surveyed the bustling breakfast table and the attentive butler before his gaze settled back on her.

"Please," Odette murmured softly, her eyes imploring. Even when expressing remorse, she remained steadfast and determined, her resolve etched onto her features.

Bastian regarded his beseeching wife with a stern countenance, as if she were a creditor demanding payment. Yet, he sat down across from Odette with a smile, giving away little of his inner thoughts. It was clear that the butler had enlisted Odette's help in coaxing his master to partake of breakfast, and the diligent woman had taken on the task with her characteristic determination, even if it meant spouting some nonsensical words in the early hours of the day.

The coffee, which was as tasteless as plain water, was the first thing Bastian sipped. There were no longer the sugar cubes that were normally arranged together. Lovis looked resolved to believe in the hostess’ power.

"I know you may not feel like eating right now, but it's important to have something more substantial than just coffee. I don't want it to harm your health." Odette spoke softly, concern etched on her face. 

Bastian sat across from her, his chin resting on his hand as he held the egg spoon. “Why? Do you worry about becoming a widow?" Tak, an eggshell breaking sound, then a light-hearted query.

“Yes. I don't want to be left all by myself. I wouldn't like a world without you."  Odette eventually smiled as she peered at Bastian's egg cup. In reality, she always told the truth when she lied, but the egg-fortune reading was really a ruse to catch Tira's attention, similar to how it is right now.

"After closely examining the egg like a curious scholar.” Odette declared, "It's a lucky star," She returned it to Bastian. "Seems like it's going to be a good day for you."  She then placed a plate of bread, vegetables, and fruits next to his egg cup with care. "Once you finish those eggs, your fortune will be granted," she said.

Odette's eyes shone with sincerity as she told the most ridiculous lie. Bastian looked at her quizzically but complied nonetheless, scooping up a spoonful of egg.

Seeing the expression of admiration on the old butler's face, Odette's sense of accomplishment was multiplied. It was her first task of the day and she had successfully completed it. It was also a morning of good luck for Odette, as a lucky star had appeared.



"Has he received any news from his daughter yet?" 

Theodora's eyes opened unexpectedly, and she posed the question. Her maid, who was in the middle of combing her hair, quickly looked up at her master's reflection in the mirror.

"Unfortunately, no. It's been said that he's waiting for his daughter like a corpse these days. But, the Duke's daughter is still nowhere to be seen," came the reply.

"What a pity," Theodora sighed, clicking her tongue in sympathy, before closing her eyes once more.

With a surprise in tow, Susan returned from her vacation, carrying with her the forgotten puzzle piece of Duke Dyssen. Despite being crippled from a fall, the Duke's past and possible significance to the world had been all but forgotten. But now, it seemed that his son-in-law and daughter were the cause of his unfortunate fate.

Susan's devotion to her sister did not go unnoticed by Theodora, who rewarded her with the opportunity to be her personal maid for a while. And, as a sign of gratitude, Theodora made sure to compensate Susan financially, twice the amount her sister received from Bastian for taking care of the Duke.

Although her husband disagreed, Theodora believed that being generous with money was essential to win people over. It was this belief that had helped her climb the social ladder.

"Convey this to your sister - she just needs to inform me of Duke Dyssen's whereabouts. There's no danger involved." Once her hair was fully brushed, Theodora stood up and picked up a pair of pearl earrings from her dressing table. Susan often admired them, and her eyes widened as Theodora handed them to her. Theodora believed that being generous with her wealth was a key to winning people's hearts and reaching her current status.

“Dear Madam, This is not required of you. Oh, my God. I won't dare take this priceless item."

"I understand your hesitation, Susan, but please don't refuse. We've been friends for so long," Theodora said, placing a hand on Susan's trembling one as she offered the pearl earrings.

Overwhelmed with gratitude, Susan couldn't help but tear up as she carefully wrapped the precious jewels and left.

Theodora let out a deep sigh, settled back onto the sofa, and reached for her cigarette. She was skeptical of what she had just heard, considering it to be mostly nonsense. Nevertheless, if there was something to gain from it, she could potentially hasten the day when she could live with her curtains wide open once again.

Theodora had a strong gut feeling about Bastian's wife, even though there was no concrete proof to support it. To ease her nerves, she lit up a few cigarettes and started her day by visiting her son's room.

Despite her repeated pleas for her son to treat his fiancée kindly, Theodora saw no significant improvement in his behavior towards her. The situation had gotten so bad that the Countess Klein had even called to express her daughter's distress over not having seen her fiancé in a while. 

While the Countess's request for the couple to have some social time together was made in jest, the underlying message was clear: if Theodora's son wanted a safe and successful wedding, he needed to treat his future bride with the respect and care she deserved.

Theodora's indomitable pride was dealt a blow, and she had to swallow it. It was nothing short of a miracle for the Klauswitz family, a noble house of lesser standing, to be accepted as in-laws by the esteemed Klein family. The engagement process was by no means an easy feat, and it wouldn't have been possible without the unyielding determination of Ella, who had wholeheartedly fallen for Franz.

"Franz." Theodora impatiently knocked on the door and called out her son's name.

 Despite receiving no report of his departure, there was no response from Franz even after waiting for a long time.

Theodora, used to this, pulled a key from her skirt pocket and unlocked the door. The room was empty save for its master, and the early sunlight poured in through the window.

‘Anyway, it doesn’t look like he’s up to speed.’ Theodora's brows wrinkled sharply as she gazed out the window at the countryside.

Theodora's gaze fell on the imposing mansion outside the window, a constant reminder of Bastian's defiance. Againts its prominence, Franz remained unfazed. It was no wonder her husband held a disapproving view of their son.

Theodora was just about to walk away when something caught her eye – an easel standing on the balcony outside the window. She gently touched her throbbing head before hurrying over to take a closer look. It was then that she realized why Franz had been neglecting his fiancée – he was engrossed in his art once more.

Theodora's resolve to reprimand her son for his negligence dissolved upon seeing the painting on the easel. An unfinished portrait of a stunning beauty, unmistakably Bastian's wife, Odette. With a quick chuckle, Theodora gazed out at the sea.


Chapter 58.
I Promise.


As Odette was preparing to take a stroll, she was interrupted by the news of a phone call from Tira, who resided at Gillis Girls' Academy's dormitory.

In haste, she concealed the bag of food she had prepared for the stray dogs and made her way to the study to answer the call.

[Hello, sister!]

With a deep breath, she lifted the receiver and heard Tira's joyful voice on the other end.

[Slow down, dear sister. You'll lose your breath]

Tira's words rushed out as she picked up the phone. 

"How's your first semester going at the new school? Are you doing well in class? And are you taking care of yourself?" Odette asked, her concern evident in her voice. Tira's playful laughter reminded Odette to calm down and enjoy the moment.

Tira's responses came in a cheerful stream, one after the other. She spoke of how the new school year had brought more fun, and how she had made many new friends with whom she shared her classes. 

Her teachers were excellent, and she was making great progress in her studies. Tira even proudly mentioned that she had added an inch to her waist, all thanks to her healthy appetite. Listening to her sister's positive report, Odette felt relieved and content.

As she sighed in relief, Tira unexpectedly shared,

 [Oh, sister, I had a dream about our father a few days ago.]

[Although it was only a dream, my father sending me to jail felt unbelievably re…]

“Stop Tira!” Odette halted Tira mid-sentence, sensing a deep-seated anxiety in her younger sister's voice. "Don't worry about it, Tira. I already told Father I would shoulder the burden," 

[But sister…]

“Listen up, Tira. If you say that one more time, I will never see you again.” Odette rechecked the tightly closed library door and scolded Tira coldly.

Tira's sullen voice broke the heavy silence as she spoke, [I'm sorry, sister. I like everything that's happening now, and that's why I was anxious. I've never been this happy before, but I was so afraid of losing it all.]

“It's all right, Tira.” Odette's voice, which had become warmer once more, calmed Tira. "I never will allow that to happen." She made a serious commitment to herself as well.

Tira let out a small laugh. [I'll truly forget about it now. Just promise me you won't say such frightening things again. You may have a new family now, sister, but you're still my sister. Without you, I'm all alone.]

"Okay, I promise," Odette replied with a soft sigh and a chuckle. "You know, Tira, you're actually my only family." Her unspoken thoughts about her fake family flooded her mind.

Tira's mood swings subsided quickly, and she regained her cheerfulness. She excitedly shared stories about learning to ride a bike with her friend, a kind boy from a neighboring boys' school, and the upcoming school festival next month. Hearing these refreshing and innocent tales from a schoolgirl's life, Odette's lingering worries dissipated.

[Sister, would you be able to come to the parent invitation day? Even though it's held during the festival, to me, you're like a mother.] 

As the phone call was coming to a close, Tira asked Odette a tentative question.

 [I don't want to trouble you. If you're busy, it's okay not to come. And you don't have to bring actual parents, they said.]

"I'll see if the schedule permits," Odette excused her tardiness in responding with a firm response.

Carlsbar was a distant city that demanded at least a two-day absence, regardless of how tight Odette's schedule was. Obtaining Bastian's permission was crucial, as it was a matter of proper protocol between employer and employee, as he had defined it.

[Okay, I'll talk to you next time. Love you, sis. Bye!] 

As Tira bid farewell with a cheery tone, it was apparent that she was crestfallen. However, before Odette could respond with a whisper of "I love you too," the phone line went dead.

With a firm grip on her emotions, Odette departed from the study, her face devoid of any personal sentiments. The day was beautiful, the sky clear and warm, and she was determined not to allow herself to be consumed by futile melancholy and ruin the pleasant day.

Let’s accept force majeure. Let’s not dwell on things that can’t be helped with your own strength. Let’s find what’s best for the situation and enjoy it. She knew it wouldn’t work out, but Odette still made that promise every morning.

Despite the worsening state of her life, there was one ritual that Odette clung to with unwavering devotion. It was a small, seemingly insignificant act, but it held immense power over her psyche. With each passing day, the pattern of her routine grew more intricate, like the threads of a tapestry that interwove to create a beautiful and intricate design.

"Madam, you have a visitor," the butler announced, his voice as crisp and polished as his uniform.

As Odette returned to her room, she was hit with yet another unwelcome surprise - her carefully stashed bag of food was missing. With a heavy sigh, she resigned herself to the fact that she would have to hide it again, this time under the bed. After hastily straightening her disheveled clothes, she braced herself and opened the bedroom door.

The unexpected arrival of a guest sent ripples of surprise through the otherwise tranquil household. Startled, Odette turned to the head maid for an explanation. "I didn't know we had any guests today," 

The head maid, ever poised and professional, held out a visiting card with practiced ease. "Yes, Madam," she replied, her voice as smooth as silk. "He claims to have no prior appointment, but requests a moment of your time."

Odette's gaze widened as she scanned the name of the unexpected visitor - Maxime von Xanders.



As Bastian idly gazed out the car window, his eyes happened to catch a familiar figure on the street corner. It was his father, Jeff Klauswitz, exiting a high-end jewelry store with a young woman who appeared to be no more than a few years older than Franz.

Despite the bustling energy of the downtown district and the frenetic pace of the rush hour traffic, Bastian felt his world slow down to a crawl. He watched in silent disbelief as his father and the unknown woman strolled away from the store, hand in hand, seemingly oblivious to the world around them.

It was a moment frozen in time, a surreal tableau that would forever be etched in Bastian's mind.

It being their first encounter, but the woman's appearance was eerily familiar to Bastian. With her platinum locks and piercing sky blue eyes, she exuded a delicate and innocent beauty - much like his deceased mother.

Bastian snorted in derision and turned away from the distasteful scene before him. He knew that his father's latest mistress would not last long - once she passed the age at which his mother had died, she would be swiftly replaced with another young and beautiful woman.

As he sat in the bar, surrounded by the flickering glow of neon lights and the raucous chatter of the patrons, he couldn't help but feel a pang of bitterness towards his stepmother. Her unwavering devotion to his father, and her desperate attempts to usurp Mrs. Klauswitz's position, were nothing but a sad parody of love - a far cry from the deep and meaningful connection that his mother had shared with her undeserving partner.

Yet, even in the face of such trifling matters, Bastian remained steadfast in his convictions. He would never let anyone forget the true magnitude of his mother's love - a love that transcended time, space, and even death itself.

With the traffic jam finally clearing up, Bastian revved his engine and left the city behind him in a blur of speed and adrenaline.

Meanwhile, back in the heart of Berg, the race to secure the rights for building a railway connecting the north and south was reaching a fever pitch. 

For weeks, it seemed that Jeff Klauswitz was the clear frontrunner - until a new challenger emerged from the shadows. It was a railway company that Bastian had founded in collaboration with LaViere - a formidable force that threatened to upend Klauswitz's plans and change the face of Berg forever.

As the news broke that Jeff Klauswitz had been denied the right to build the railroad, Bastian felt a surge of satisfaction - knowing that this setback would deal a major blow to his father's ambitions, and force him to go even deeper into the trap that Bastian had carefully set.

But Bastian knew that he couldn't rest on his laurels just yet. With Jeff now desperate to find a way out of this mess, he would undoubtedly make some rash and aggressive investments - all in the hopes of finding a breakthrough that could save his plans.

Thankfully, he had been preparing for this day for months - and he was ready for whatever his father might throw at him. As he sat back and waited for Jeff to take the bait, he felt a sense of quiet confidence - knowing that he had outsmarted his old man once again.

Bastian smoked his cigarette and accelerated as he crossed the boundary between Ratz and Ardene.

In actuality, the endeavor was not worthwhile. Because his father would destroy himself even if left alone.

After his father's initial rapid growth - thanks to the funds he had raised from the Illis family through his marriage - the Klauswitz Empire had hit a wall. For months, it had remained stagnant - unable to make any real progress or outmaneuver the ruthless rivals who were now closing in from all sides.

Againts his best efforts, Jeff Klauswitz knew that his chances of survival in this cutthroat business world were growing slimmer by the day. His enemies were relentless, and his resources were dwindling - leaving him with little room to maneuver or make a comeback.

Even if his father had luck on his side, it was a game that would cease as soon as Franz acquired the family firm.

This was the most fitting conclusion given that the beloved son who had striven to become a nobleman would ultimately bring the family to ruin.

Yet, what moved him wasn't the rage and retaliation that everyone was talking about.

They were already meaningless to Bastian. Since he left that household, it had already been that way.

Bastian had a different opinion from his maternal grandfather who claimed it was because they made his heart ache. It was not bad for him to have the disease to live with if this composure was a result of the illness.

Nonetheless, his grandpa favored it.

He died without even properly closing his eyes because he had lived with the resentment of not being able to exact revenge for his daughter's unjust death. To the son of his daughter, he left everything.

Bastian received more than simply a hefty inheritance as the Illis family's heir. He owed it to his maternal grandfather, who delivered him from that misery and provided him with the greatest affection and resources, to close his eyes.

Even so, he wished to guarantee it unequivocally. His father had sacrificed his wife and child to gain the great honor and lineage he had. Partial aristocratic standing. Without money, would it truly be so good?

If his father lost everything he had made thanks to the money from the junk dealer he hated so much, the solution would become apparent. If his father went bankrupt but was still content to hold that shell, Bastian considered appreciating his father.

The success of this case was crucial to accelerate the plan, as it was necessary to decrease reliance on Laviere. While he currently maintained an amicable relationship with Laviere and worked together with him, there was no permanent ally. This was also why Sandrine was his most valuable asset, as her mixed heritage provided the most effective safety net.

What if he could soar without the aid of Laviere's wings?

 As the Gulf of Ardene loomed in the distance, an unfamiliar family unexpectedly crossed his mind. Although it was not entirely out of the question, taking such a challenging path seemed unnecessary when he already had a powerful alliance that fulfilled all his requirements. With a decisive conclusion, Bastian shifted gears once again and accelerated his pace.

As the mansion loomed closer, the memory of this morning's fortune-telling nonsense lingered in his mind. "It's the bolt of wisdom. You will have an important realization today." Odette continued to speak eloquently while examining the long, thin eggshells that had shattered.

Bastian was keeping his eye on her to see how far she would go before ending the con. He also realized that it would be better to wed Sandrine, suggesting that perhaps Odette's absurd forecast was correct after all.

He arrived at the home as the sun was setting.

Bastian marched into the lobby after handing the car to the attendant, who fled out in shock. The butler, who had been informed of his earlier return, had just arrived as he set foot on the central staircase.

"Master, you're ba…,"

“Bastian!”  

Before Lovis could finish, Odette's voice rang out clearly, calling his name. Turning his head towards the landing, Bastian saw Odette making her way down the entrance hall, accompanied by a man holding a child.

Bastian was caught off guard by the unexpected arrival of Maxime von Xander


Chapter 59.
Classy Scandal.


"If I departed without seeing Captain Klauswitz, I thought it would be unfortunate. I am happy you are here.” Maxime hastily handed over his daughter to the nanny who was following behind as he expressed his disappointment about leaving without meeting Captain Klauswitz.

"Good day, Sir Xanders," Bastian replied as he shook the Count's hand. "I wasn't anticipating your visit to my humble abode." He glanced briefly at Odette, who had approached him silently, before returning his attention to Maxime. Despite the unexpectedness of the Count's arrival, Maxime's cheerful countenance betrayed no hint of remorse.

"Ah, let me start by apologizing for my rudeness. I came without making an appointment beforehand," Maxime said.

"Is there something urgent that requires your attention?" asked Bastia.

Maxime's expression was filled with genuine remorse, "I wanted to invite both of you to my villa to properly apologize for Alma's mistake at the last party. However, due to some family matters, I must leave Ardene earlier than planned."

Bastian greeted the Count's explanation with a warm, amiable smile. Although there were no overt signs of any foul play, he couldn't claim to fully comprehend the Count's reasoning.

The Count possessed an abundance of kindness that had the ability to win over even the most skeptical of souls. However, despite his outwardly humble demeanor, his true nature was one of arrogance, much like a wolf in sheep's clothing. What made it all the more perplexing was that he seemed completely oblivious to this fact, as if he were under some sort of enchantment that prevented him from recognizing his own flaws.

"If that's the case, why don't you join us for dinner tonight?" Bastian extended a gracious invitation to him. Though he felt that their relationship wasn't particularly significant, he understood the importance of maintaining civility and adhering to social norms.

Maxime chuckled like a carefree youth and shook his head, "No, thank you for the offer, but I must be on my way to catch the train on time. I only stopped by to say hello before my departure."

"All right, let's get a cup of tea. I won't feel comfortable if you go in this manner.” Bastian insisted.

"I had the pleasure of having tea time with Mrs. Klauswitz earlier. Please don't worry about that, as she treated an unexpected and uninvited guest with exceptional hospitality. Alma and I are truly grateful for your kindness."

In response, Odette smiled warmly and expressed her pleasure in being able to extend hospitality to Maxime and Alma.

"I would like to once again apologize for Alma's mistake on that day. I will make sure to educate my child properly to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future."

 Maxime offered a sincere apology to Bastian,  As he spoke, the nanny arrived holding the child, catching Maxime's eye.

The Count gathered his daughter Alma into his arms and approached Bastian once more, urging her to apologize for her mistake. "Come on, Alma. It's important that you apologize to Captain Klauswitz," 

However, upon meeting Bastian's gaze, Alma became overwhelmed with emotion and buried her face in her father's embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Bastian was actually unaware of what mistake the child had made. He observed the father and daughter spending time with a woman who bore a striking resemblance to the Count's deceased wife, and noted Odette's excessive display of affection towards a stranger's child. It all left him with a sense of intrigue and curiosity.

It seemed to Bastian that the adults were trying to shift the responsibility for their mistakes onto a child who was completely innocent and unaware of what had transpired. He couldn't help but think that if the Count was truly apologetic, he wouldn't have shown up again.

As Bastian observed the Count's comically arrogant behavior, the child in his arms began to squirm and open her mouth, perhaps sensing the tension in the air.

“I’m sorry….Captain.” Alma apologized to Captain Klauswitz in a quiet whisper. Her frightened eyes brimming with tears. Even with tears filled her frightened eyes, the child did her part quite resolutely.

Bastian gracefully cocked his head to accept the young lady's audacity. He was instantly distracted, though, when his perceptive eye caught a glimpse of something odd. The child's blouse's collar was embellished with a piece of commonplace lace that, although being common, had an oddly familiar color and shape. His intuition was confirmed as he looked at it more attentively; it was the wonderfully made collar that Odette had been diligently knitting over the last few days.

There was no denying it - Bastian's heart raced with excitement as he beheld the accessory before him. It was not a figment of his imagination; it was real, and he had committed every minute detail to memory. From the tiniest intricacy to the grander purpose of the seemingly insignificant object, he had scrutinized it with unwavering curiosity.

Maxime showed his love and pride for his daughter by giving her several gentle kisses on the cheeks. Bastian had a glimpse of Odette in the child's dazzling grin at this very moment. While they may have had different physical characteristics, there was an unmistakable similarity in the way they made an impact on others around them.

"Allow me to extend an invitation for both of you to visit Xander's estate in the near future. It would be my pleasure to repay the debt," said Maxime before they were informed that the car had arrived. With that, Maxime bid his final farewell.

Bastian stood with Odette, watching the guests say their goodbyes as they left. The fact that Xander's car was already loaded with their luggage and standing outside the stately home suggested that the Count's assurance to drop by before departing was sincere. The father and daughter got into the car and drove off into the peaceful, dusk landscape.

After a moment, Odette turned to face Bastian. "Congratulations on being accepted into Xander's circle," she exclaimed, as if it were a tremendous honor to win the favor of the wealthy widower. However, Bastian's mood became even more tumultuous at the sight of her dazzling smile.

Mrs. Klauswitz, who put a lot of effort into everything, didn't shirk her responsibility to select a compatible affair partner. It was a commendably excellent professional skill.



As nightfall descended, the forest was cloaked in darkness. Odette set down her wine glass and gazed out the window of the breakfast room, her expression etched with concern. It had been nearly ten days since she began caring for the stray dogs in the woods. Though they remained untamed and cautious, they consistently returned to the same spot each day, waiting for her to arrive with their food during her walks.

Today was no exception to the routine. Letting out a sigh, Odette redirected her attention to the table.  ‘What if I request to be excused first?’

Odette thought about her prior choice as she struggled with her emotions. She wasn't ready to take on the responsibilities of a marriage just yet. She resisted letting her feelings endanger the crucial matters of the day.

"After the naval festival is over, would be the optimal time to pay a visit to the Xanders, don't you think?" Odette spoke up, breaking the oppressive silence with her well-timed words. Bastian, who had been silently clearing his plate, finally lifted his gaze across the table.

"Do as you please." Setting down his wine glass, Bastian responded in a curt tone.  It was clear that he wasn't pleased with the newfound connections she had formed. Though she wasn't seeking praise, his disapproving reply was somewhat disconcerting.

"Is it possible that you harbor some dislike towards Sir Xanders?" Amidst her struggle, Odette approached the topic cautiously.

Bastian's face lit up with a smile as the candelabra's glow illuminated the dining table. "I can hardly believe it," he said. "I believe Count Xanders has the potential to create a tasteful scandal. It's a valuable network, so be sure to handle it with care."

Bastian continued speaking in his usual plain and soft tone, without any change in his expression.

 "Do you suspect that Sir Xanders and I are currently engaged in an inappropriate relationship?" Odette asked.

"Whether the two of you are in a committed relationship or simply sharing a noble friendship is of no concern to me. I simply require that Maxime von Xanders be the cause of our divorce," Bastian nonchalantly raised his eyebrows and resumed his use of cutlery. "He is a wealthy, well-mannered, and highly-educated nobleman, which is sufficient reason for me to relinquish my wife. You have chosen your partner wisely, Odette, and I am pleased with your selection."

Bastian sliced through the meat, spewing vile and vicious words without a care. Odette was left speechless, frozen in shock as she observed the unsettling spectacle. If she had mustered the courage to speak out against his behavior, it might have been dismissed as a mere misunderstanding. However, Bastian's demeanor was chillingly devoid of any empathy or warmth. His behavior was cold, like ice.

The scene brought back thoughts of that tragic spring afternoon when Bastian had proposed and given her a contract. She was now expecting an explanation from him, but all she got was a placid demeanor as he carried on eating. She was suddenly repelled by the meat's dark red interior, which had barely undergone surface cooking. It was a reflection of the man who was avidly munching the bloodied meat from the seat across from her.

He was a beast, or at least he looked like a beast in Odette's eyes.

Odette had known for a long time that this man would use any strategy to further his goals, but this affair was much beyond her comprehension.

"Sir Xanders has nothing to do with me. I am willing to agree to any grounds for the divorce, but I refuse to let an innocent person be dragged into this." 

"Perhaps it's time for you to work on building a good relationship," Bastian suggested, swallowing the last morsel of meat and reaching for the napkin. "It looks good on you, by the way" he added with a nonchalant smile as he neatly folded the napkin he had just used to wipe his lips.

A terrible man.

Odette had to work to keep her hatred from escaping her mouth. She immediately concealed her hands under the table, but they were already trembling with unfathomable wrath.

"Sir Xanders is a decent man. Please don't make careless insults," Odette reprimanded Bastian, assuming the role of a stern teacher. Bastian laughed as if he had heard the funniest joke and refilled his empty glass.

"Isn't it great that you two are perfect for each other? I'm just glad that my wife is leaving me for a decent man, at least it'll make me look good. You'll have a wonderful husband, and I don't think there could be a better outcome," 

"I'm sorry, what did you just say?" Odette asked, taken aback by the comment.

“Don't worry, I will pay alimony for that portion if you want. Of course, you will have to face the harm to your image caused by you and Count Xanders having an affair.” 

“Do you really think that money can buy anything?” 

"You have proven that nothing is impossible." 

"You are quite filthy." Odette let her anger speak.

"Is cleanliness your virtue? And who sold their life for money?" Bastian, clutching his wine glass, responded with a question and a statement that sounded like a song.

Odette's pale blue face was filled with a fierce glare as she rose to her feet. Though her eyes were reddened with tears, she refused to let them fall.

As he listened to the sound of his wife's footsteps fading away, Bastian slowly tipped his glass. The butler had carefully selected the wine for the master and his wife's dinner, and the rich, fragrant aroma filled the air.


Chapter 60.
Don't Let This Night Ruin Me.


Beneath the shade of the maple tree, where unspoken promises lingered in the air, an empty tin can was all that remained.

Odette rushed over to inspect it, scanning her surroundings for any sign of the stray dogs that had been causing trouble. They were nowhere to be found, as she had expected, but the sight still left her feeling a little disheartened. She, wanted or unwanted, blamed Bastian for stirring all this chaos.

Despite her awareness that her resentment was misplaced, Odette's hatred for Bastian refused to subside.

If only he had arrived home after Count Xanders had left, they never would have crossed paths. Odette despised the thought of making excuses for herself, but her mind wouldn't let go of the self-justification

Her words, spoken in anger, were carried away on the chilling wind that shook the night forest, as if they were mere leaves scattered in its wake. "Bad man," she muttered, as if the words themselves held the power to release the frustration building up inside her.

"I will never shed a tear over this marriage," she vowed to herself, willing her resolve to remain steadfast.

As the previously blurry landscape came back into focus, Odette made her way towards the maple tree that marked the entrance to the path. With gentle hands, she cleared away the dry leaves and discarded acorn shells that had accumulated in the nearby tin can.

With a sigh, Odette rose to her feet and dusted off her hands. "Oh, Puppy," she called out into the darkness of the path ahead.

As the sound of flapping wings faded away, the forest once again descended into silence, leaving Odette alone with her thoughts.

She called out for the dogs several more times, but received no response. Exhausted, Odette leaned against the trunk of a magnificent tree and contemplated her next move.

She knew she should hurry back, having used the excuse of taking a stroll around the garden for a brief respite. But something within her urged her to wait a little longer, to give the dogs a chance to return. 

Other animals might steal the food if she left it in this condition.

The sound of a nightingale singing appeared out of nowhere. Odette listened to the song while quietly closing her eyes.

Hui-hwi! The clear, haunting melody began like a simple whistle, but as the musician's skilled fingers danced across the strings, it transformed into a symphony of sound, rich and vibrant with a variety of techniques.

The nightingale was her mother's favorite bird, and it was easy to see why. Even when she could no longer attend the grand theaters and hear the sweeping orchestras that once filled her life with joy, the sweet songs of the nightingale still brought her comfort and peace.

On the night of the last nightingale's song, Odette sat by her mother's bedside, holding her hand as she listened to the haunting melody that filled the room. It was then that her mother whispered a secret wish - that in her next life, she would be reborn as the nightingale, singing with a voice as pure and sweet as the bird that had brought her so much joy.

"But can't you only sing beautifully when you're filled with pain and emotion?" Odette asked her mother, watching as she closed the window to shut out the chill of the night air. "You always said that music should come from the heart."

Her mother helplessly smiled at her daughter's words "You have such a curious mind, my dear.”

Curious mind…

The mother who regularly polished Odette mumbled some strange words of regret.

“Odette. I love you, my daughter."

Her mother covered her face with a thin hand after lengthy moments of devoted attention to her.

"Should the time come when I can no longer shield you from harm, my darling, promise me you'll live as a blissful fool," She implored, her tear-stained face illuminated by the moonlight. It was a strange and enigmatic request.

"I’m sorry…."

After giving that final word, her mother sighed deeply and drifted off to sleep as if it were carrying the weight of her entire existence. Helen, the unlucky princess, died unexpectedly the following morning.

The act of betrayal was undeniable. For Odette, her mother had been her everything. She taught her every little thing - from speaking, walking, and laughing, to observing, listening, and reflecting. When Odette was no longer able to have a tutor, her mother became her teacher.

Her mother didn't spare her, not even when her feet hurt from dancing in uncomfortable shoes or when her knuckles swelled from hitting the piano keys when she couldn't play well.

She continued to learn by reading library books, and when she fell short of her mother's expectations, she would receive a ruthless spanking. Her mother remained hopeful that one day they would regain their former high status. For that phantom.

As Odette received the heartless master's final command for her to become a fool, disbelief consumed her. She had always been a dutiful daughter, following her mother's every instruction, but she refused to comply with this last wish.

She didn't want to follow the pointless ambitions that had plagued her mother her entire life. She simply didn't want to abandon the life she had so far devoted to it. After all, she wasn’t her mother; her mother had eventually given up and fled.

Yet, now her life was the same now since, as the man claimed, she sold her life for money.

‘One day, I'll be living in my own home and leading the life I want to lead.’

The notion of glory that didn't truly belong to her was of no interest to Odette, regardless of the location. What truly captured her imagination was the possibility of finding a place where she could shed her false identity and be truly herself. As she contemplated the end of her marriage, Odette couldn't help but dream of a future where she could make that a reality.

Her closed eyes slowly opened to the sound of the nightingale's incessant cries. As she listened to the bird's melodious song, a thought crossed her mind - what if her mother had returned as a bird and sang to her about leaving without being taught? The idea brought a bittersweet feeling.

Odette adjusted her stance and took a breath while checking the clock.

She had no regrets, so perhaps her mother was correct. She had to make the most of the decision she had already made.

She refused to follow her mother's sad life, which she blamed on being imprisoned in the past. Never, never, never.

“Puppy.” Odette let out one final call for the stray dogs, but as she turned to leave, she caught a glimpse of a pup emerging from the nearby bushes. Though she searched for the mother dog, who had always followed her child, she was nowhere to be seen.

As Odette approached the lone pup, "What are you doing here all alone? Where's your mother?" But the frightened pup just whimpered and darted off into the pathless woods without even glancing at the food she had brought.

Odette did not move, so the dog returned and growled. It appeared to be beckoning her to follow him.

Odette stared blankly into the pitch-black trees. Once more, the puppy began to run in its direction.



The night was drawing to a close, yet Odette had not returned.

 Bastian grew anxious as he lit his third cigarette and rose from his seat. Even though, Odette had said she was going for a leisurely walk in the garden, even Lovis had witnessed her departure.

Bastian's patience wore thin as the hours passed and Odette failed to return. He couldn't fathom why she would storm out of the mansion in anger, putting herself in potential danger.

Her behavior was out of character for the responsible and level-headed Odette. What's worse, she knew the consequences of defying their agreement, making her actions all the more reckless and worrisome to Bastian.

Bastian glanced at his watch once more before making his way to the window that overlooked the garden. As he drew back the curtains, he was met with the sight of a gentle rain shower that had crept up on him unnoticed, painting the glass pane with droplets.

Stepping out onto the balcony, he felt the cool breeze that carried the scent of the rain on his skin. Bastian sighed in resignation and hastily started getting ready to depart.

All he did was cover up his clothing with a raincoat. There was no time to be concerned about anything else.

As he descended to the first-floor hall, Lovis met him with an anxious expression. "I'll mobilize the servants to search for madam." 

“No. One is sufficient."  Without pausing, Bastian shook his head. A rapid and discrete solution was required in order to prevent the spread of unneeded misinformation. Little disputes and resolutions. So that it might represent a typical couple's day to day activities.

"Stop worrying, Lovis. Odette may be somewhere I already know." Bastian quickly departed the estate after deceiving the butler with a cunning tale.

Odette would have hidden farther away if she had remained in the garden, where he would have seen her long ago. She was probably in the woods because the beach that he had often observed through the window was deserted.

Bastian's mind raced as he swiftly made his way towards his destination. His footsteps pounded against the forest floor, quickening with every passing moment. The rain pelted down around him, a familiar and unwelcome sensation. 

It had been years since he had wandered through the Ardene forests on a night like this, but the memories flooded back to him in a rush, overpowering and vivid.

-

With a jolt, Bastian realized he was no longer in his cozy bed, but in the midst of a vast forest, dressed only in his pajamas and barefoot. As he tried to make sense of what had happened, his mind slowly cleared and a sense of calm overtook him.

"I sleepwalk," Bastian murmured to himself, as he embraced the cold, rainy darkness of the forest.

Bastian already knew that while he was asleep, he occasionally prowled the night like a ghost. He had long ago reached the point when he could no longer continue to live in denial and conceal his condition.

That explained it. Before going to sleep, he began to tie rope around his wrists. Hence, nobody would learn. The only thing would be to wake up chained and alone.

Bastian had become an expert at concealing his weakness, and he knew that if he woke up early enough and erased all traces, he could keep it hidden. Despite moving to the Illis’s residence, the nights of wandering continued to haunt him, but he was able to keep them under wraps. However, one fateful weekend morning, after several months of living with his grandfather, Bastian slipped up and revealed his vulnerability. His carelessness had led him to oversleep.

Curiosity had seized his grandfather, compelling him to open the locked door and peer inside. What he discovered was his grandson sprawled on the bedroom floor, as if he had been tamed like an animal on a leash. Bastian jolted awake at the sound of his grandfather's piercing screams.

"Who did this to you? Who made you like this? Tell me now!" His grandfather's anger was palpable as he quickly untied the rope and interrogated Bastian, 

“Sir, I did."  Little Bastian replied in a collected manner. His fight while restrained by his rope had left him with wounds that were oozing with blood, but the discomfort was not severe enough to warrant concern.

That fateful morning, the world seemed to crumble as his grandfather wept uncontrollably, shattering the silence around them. With a pang of regret, Bastian wished he hadn't slept in and made matters worse by uttering something he shouldn't have.

Determined to find a cure for Bastian's sleepwalking, his grandfather scoured the vast empire for a solution. With unwavering commitment, Bastian underwent the treatment, silently enduring the process. The passing of time brought with it the sweet relief of a complete cure, as well as the fading of scars on his wrists.

Bastian came to a halt at the end of the path that connected the dense forest to the sandy beach, rain pelting his face and chilling him to the bone. As he wiped the droplets from his skin, he felt the memories of the past fading into nothingness, leaving behind only one constant thought: Odette.

The elusive and vexing woman had disappeared without a trace, even after he had combed the trails that wound through the forest.

Bastian drew in a deep breath, his heart pounding with determination as he lengthened his strides. He knew that Odette was somewhere within the sprawling grounds of the grand mansion, even if she had lost her way. The chances of a catastrophic accident were low, but still, he couldn't shake the intense emotions that consumed him.

The memory of the unpleasant dinner table argument lingered, and despite his knowledge of her  innocence, he couldn't stop the hurtful words that had slipped from his tongue. 

Bastian became dejected as he realized that this kind of conflict was all too often. Yet he didn't let it break him; he used his fortitude and fortitude to confront it. He set out to locate the starting place with fresh vigor.

Although there were still traces of winter in the air, the setting sun shed a warm glow over the early spring evening. And it was at this precise time that the unlucky woman took off her veil.

He felt a sense of regret as he realized he should have taken the chance that fateful night. In the stillness of the night, the burden of his inaction weighed heavily on him. He might have been nothing more than a fleeting memory or a one-night stand if he had just seized the chance. Even if destiny reunited them as husband and wife, their relationship would never be the same as it may have been.

The emperor's decree held immense weight, but even its power could not compel him to cross paths again with the woman who peddled her flesh in the shadowy corners of the gambling den. He had brought her into his world, against his better judgment, and it was a mistake that could not be undone. But if this was to be the end, then it should be concluded with precision, according to plan.

Bastian's mind sliced through the haze of uncertainty with a resolute decision, much like the young boy of his past who bound his own wrists to shield himself from the tumultuous nights.

He noticed the presence of people on the road going to the cliff overlooking the sea about the time he understood that more searches would be required.

With cautious steps, Bastian drew closer to the towering tree that stood sentinel at the edge of the cliff. A heavy exhale escaped his lips as he spotted a figure beneath its gnarled roots, lost in deep contemplation.

"Odette," 

He breathed, the sound barely audible above the rustling leaves.

At the sound of her name, the woman caked in mud slowly turned her head towards him. And in that moment, Bastian knew that it was his wife, Odette.
