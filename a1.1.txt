.

His gaze was drawn to the crest of a carriage running alongside them as he admired dazzling array of lights that illuminated the city.  A golden rose. Glorious insignia of the Herhardt Family.

Unable to resist his curiosity, Jeff sneaked a sideways glance through the carriage window, and there he saw the owner of the Duke's family, reputed to be the most powerful aristocrat in the empire, a young man barely the age of his own son. As if sensing Jeff's stare on him, the Duke slowly turned his head.

As their eyes met, the young Duke Herhardt showed no sign of agitation. Instead, he politely tilted the tip of his chin in greeting before calmly withdrawing his gaze. Jeff, sitting across from his son Franz, couldn't help but feel a sense of expectation in the air.

“Finally, I get to meet Duke Herhardt today.” Jeff said, looking at his son.

Franz, engrossed in his book, raised his head, "What do you mean by that?" he asked, confused.

"Your fiancee," Jeff explained. "Since she is the daughter of a family within Herhardt's social circle, she can help you connect with Duke Herhardt."

But Franz was not convinced. "Father, Lady Klein and Duke Herhardt have no personal relationship," he protested.

Theodora Klauswitz, had been observing the exchange between father and son, quickly cut in. "Your father, right," she said, understanding the situation. “If we finds it difficult to approach him directly, Count Klein might be able to set up a meeting for us, Franz, isn't that right?” Theodora sent a command-like challenge to her son with her commanding gaze. Franz shook his head in resignation, hesitated.

“How many years have you attended the same school? I'm surprised you've never tried to correctly combine words before." Jeff Klauswitz eyed the philosophical book on Franz's lap and let out a long sigh.

Franz Klauswitz, his second son was exceptionally brilliant, of course.

His creative ability was also exceptional, and he was intelligent enough to stand out in a private school where youngsters from wealthy families tended to congregate. The family was very proud of their kid who earned an honors degree and was admitted to the best university in the empire.

However, beyond the classroom walls, Jeff couldn't help but find Franz's interests in philosophy and art to be a nuisance. His soft, feminine nature also made it difficult for him to fit in with the rugged world of men. The time, money and effort invested in getting him into this prestigious school felt like a fruitless endeavor.

"Father, just because we've graduated, doesn't mean we should expect to be friends with everyone. Take Duke Herhardt for example, it's a huge generation gap between my mom and Matthias von Herhardt. Our academic paths were vastly different." Furious, Franz responded. He displayed a wounded pride expression.

"Will the lady from the Dyssen family also be at this ball?" Watching the scene, Theodora hastily changed the topic. Fortunately, the name she gave worked better than expected. 

“She's a smart, downtrodden aristocrat, but she's in trouble. What kind of standard such a person will have is obvious.” The thought of that made Jeff sigh deeply.

 "Don't think too negatively," Theodora spoke with a benevolent smile on her face, her words carrying a hint of genuine concern for her stepson's future. "It's time for Bastian to get married as well. In any case, there is nothing wrong with him getting a wife who is of imperial blood."

Jeff Klauswitz, his charming and lovely face belied his middle age, smirked in response. "Indeed, you have a point," he said.

Theodora seemed to be caught in a dream as she enchantedly gazed at her husband. Since she fell head over heels in love with Jeff Klauswitz in the spring of her seventeenth year, he has been her entire universe since then. 

To Theodora, nothing was more important in the world than the man she loved. Not the difference in their social status, not the opposition of her family, not even the fact that he was already married could hinder her passionate love. She was willing to sell her soul to the devil, just to have him, and she did it. 

She gazed at the imperial palace, which had suddenly become closer, anticipation began to float in Theodora's eyes. "I must be sure to congratulate Bastian when I see him," she said. "I can only imagine the joy he feels at having been granted an audience with His Majesty the Emperor and the gift of a wife by the Emperor.”

Theodora's family, Viscount Oswald, played a pivotal role in helping the Klauswitz become acceptable members of society.  However, only Theodora, Jeff, and their second wife's children enjoyed this level of acceptance. Theodora's refusal to accept Jeff's children from his poor ex-wife represented not only the final vestige of aristocratic pride, but also her own. Because of this, Franz was able to more easily establish his position as heir.

The time has come, though, for Bastian to do so as well.

The day she found out Bastian had been invited to the Imperial Ball, Theodora was so tense and worried that she couldn't get any rest. Thankfully, she only suffered temporary discomfort. A whiff of hope filled the air when she heard that the daughter of the Duke of Dyssen would also be in attendance. Taking into account the shame Bastian would face, this event seemed like a tremendous opportunity.

"Having such a woman as a member of our family, though, would be dishonorable," Franz objected, his forehead frowned and his face twisted in distaste.

"Don't worry, Franz," Theodora replied with a carefree smile. "No one will consider Bastian's bride a member of our family. Would it not be better for it to be Illis?"

Since leaving Ardene at the age of twelve, Bastian has not spent any time in the Klauswitz estate.  His maternal family, the Illis family, had taken care of him and he considered them family. 

“Franz, your mother is correct; you need to think of your future.” Jeff Klauswitz nodded in agreement, a look of cheer on his face. Theodora beamed with love and pride, reminiscent of the day she broke Jeff free from the shackles of his ex-wife, and the day she gave birth to his noble child. It was a momentous occasion, much like Klauswitz's arrival on this earth.

Their chat ceased as the carriage arrived at its destination.

At the Imperial Palace's night, a menacing, dazzling light illuminated like a full moon dangling in the empty sky. 



“Captain Klauswitz has arrived!”

The grand doors of the banquet hall swung open with a flourish, and the guests turned their heads in unison, their eyes fixed on the entrance. Franz too, couldn't help but turn his gaze towards the door, his heart pounding with excitement.

He had never been to a banquet in the imperial palace before, and the thought of stepping into a world he had only ever dared to dream of, made him feel like he was on top of the world. He couldn't contain his joy, even as his feet bounced eagerly under the table.

But just as the ball was about to begin, Bastian's sudden humiliation only served to dampen the young man's spirits. It was a stark contrast to the high expectations of the night, and it left a sour taste in his mouth.

Bastian, with his haughty air, strolled down the path with an air of royalty. He sauntered with such arrogant confidence that it seemed as though he were the Crown Prince himself. His every step was a boast of his own importance and his every breath a claim of his own superiority. He was a shallow creature, who would only be rewarded with a mere fish for hunting those beneath him. 

Franz, with his fiancée by his side, watched in dismay as his hopes of proving himself superior to his half-brother were shattered before him. But what was more surprising than Bastian's arrogance was the glittering array of prestigious figures who greeted him warmly - from aristocrats to political and financial elites. It was a connection that seemed impossible for a mere navy captain to possess. 

The young lady of Klein, who stood among the onlookers, innocently wondered, "Is he also acquainted with Duke Herhardt?" as she observed the scene unfold.

Franz squeezed his lips hard and held his breath when Matthias von Herhardt approached Bastian and decided to shake hands first. Although the circumstance was entirely illogical, it was obvious that the two people knew one another and were close enough to interact socially in a place like this.

Franz nervously raised his cold hand to adjust his glasses, his eyes locked on Bastian as he finished his conversation with Duke Herhardt. The tension between the two brothers was palpable as Bastian slowly turned to face him.

"Hello, Franz," Bastian greeted him coolly, his eyes scanning Franz's face.

"It's nice to see you again, Lady Klein," Bastian added, turning his attention to Franz's fiancée.

“Hello, Captain Klauswitz, it’s nice to meet you at the Imperial Palace” Lady Klein said.

Franz felt his nerves get the better of him as he struggled to find the right words to say. He was relieved when his fiancée, the intelligent and sociable daughter of Count Klein, stepped in to ease the awkward atmosphere with her polite greeting. It wasn't until the end of their conversation that Franz finally found his voice.

“How do u feel about finally entering the Imperial Palace?” Franz cleared his throat and forced a casual smile, his eyes scanning the grand banquet hall of the imperial palace. He looked different than before, as if the weight of the succession classes had taken a toll on him.

"I'm so moved that I want to make this a lifetime honor," Bastian replied, his voice filled with emotion. "Just like you are," he added, glancing at his half-brother, Franz.

Bastian, inspecting the hall with a critical eye, tilted his head and smiled, as if the answer would do justice. Franz could feel his face growing warm with embarrassment.

"Well, that wouldn't be too bad," Franz said, his tone nonchalant. But even in that moment of belated bravado, he couldn't shake off his nervousness.

Just then, a cry was heard announcing the arrival of the last guest, the name he had been waiting for. The tension in the room was palpable as all eyes turned towards the entrance, waiting for the final arrival.

Franz's heart sped up as he whirled around to head the entrance of the banquet hall. A young woman, accompanied by an elderly lady with white hair, entered after a short while. She was the bride in question, the one who would ruin Bastian's first imperial ball.

Franz looked at his brother's bride with a mix of excitement and trepidation. But as Lady Odette reached the center of the hall, he suddenly had a feeling that something was terribly wrong.

This can't be right, Franz thought, his mind whirling as he sought to push aside the moment that rendered him mute.  The caustic remarks  that had flowed out of his mouth without his knowledge seeped into the crowd's amazement.

As his increasingly loud heartbeat muffled all the noise in the world, Franz watched as his brother Bastian began to move. He was like a predator stalking his prey, a piece of rotten meat thrown by the emperor towards that damn beautiful woman.

It was then that Franz realized the true nature of this imperial ball, a cruel and twisted game played by the powerful for their own amusement. And in that moment, his heart ached for the innocent young woman caught in the middle of the royal mess.


Chapter 10.

Excuses for Staying the Course.





"I must say, you're a pretty shrewd one. Using your endearing looks to charm others." The Countess of Trier scowled as she mockingly addressed Odette.

Odette stood there, her face as expressionless as a statue, the blue satin of her dress and the icy sparkle of her diamond jewelry standing out strongly against the pale marble of her face. Her corpse-like appearance gave the impression that she belonged at a funeral rather than a wedding, yet her poise and grace revealed that she was no commoner who had stolen clothes and jewels to go to the ball.

The Countess of Trier stood tall, surveying the grand banquet hall, and whispered a stern reminder to Odette. "Remember, the future of the Dyssen family rests on the success of this task."

Memories of the days when she had used less-than-ideal methods to bring Odette into the family flooded her mind as she looked upon the Marble Hall. She acknowledged that Odette's stubbornness and pride came from the imperial blood that flowed through her veins.

"Please keep your promise," Odette said, pausing to turn and look at  Countess Trier. She was bold, not arrogant, her eyes were epitome of sincerity and desperation. 

The small pension that had once been promised to Odette seemed insignificant now, but Countess Trier did not show any sign of sadness. Odette informed her that she would no longer see Bastian Klauswitz as the man had no intention of accepting the marriage proposal and his will was unaltered.

It wasn't that she couldn't relate to his emotions.

Being humiliated and brought into a foreign environment one day wasn’t that simple. It was safe to suppose that he had little chance of success if he couldn't capture the hearts of the populace by displaying all the faces he had worn.  The emperor, though, preferred it this way. 

Odette would have to portray Bastian Klauswitz's wife in front of everyone, even if she was fully exploited and then abandoned.

The Trier Countess happily approved. "“Alright. Will do that."

As Odette looked at the Countess of Trier, her heart was filled with a mix of emotions. The thought of the emperor being ruthless and not despicable was something she had never considered before. But, the Countess's words offered her a faint glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this marriage proposal could lead to something better. She couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards the Countess for her words of comfort and reassurance.

Odette sat in front of the Countess of Trier with her eyes firmly set on the horizon. She was aware that her pension would not be lost even if this marriage did not work out. That was really all she wanted. She proclaimed in a firm voice that she would carry out her obligations if the Countess could persuade the Emperor to give her a firm response.

The Countess carefully listened, her voice containing a touch of comprehension. "Although the Emperor is a harsh individual, he is not without mercy. He won't treat you like an outsider if this marriage proposal can assure Princess Isabelle's security and happiness. They may be kind enough to raise your pension even though winning the jackpot is improbable. And who knows, if luck is on your side, you might get even more."

The Countess' voice grew softer as she talked; the sight of the abandoned princess's daughter being sold for such a pittance broke her heart. Even though she used the pension's authority as a weapon, she was not pleased by Odette's suffering at all.

Odette had to wear a brave face and go through with this duty she was given, even if it was for a small chance of a better life. And so, she took a deep breath and nodded, "Thank you, Countess." She knew that she had to be strong and hopeful for her future, and for the future of the Dyssen's.

Odette expressed her gratitude in a short note before turning back to the strange environment in front of her.

Beautiful frescoes and crystal chandeliers surround the ceiling, and the enormous garden could be seen via the windows that were wide open. Everything was exactly how her mother had said it would be. It was like fairytale materializing into reality. 

Odette recalled the recollection of her mother, who initially seemed strangely upbeat when telling her about the Imperial Palace but later broke down in tears, gave her a peculiar sense.

As the garden blazed with vibrant flowers, Odette couldn't have known the heartache and sacrifice that awaited her mother on the night of the ball. Helene’s love was a tragic one, fueled by unrequited feelings and a longing for understanding. Though she idolized her mother, Odette struggled to grasp her mother's choices and the betrayal of her family and country they entailed. But as she faced the consequences of her mother's actions, Odette knew that true love always came with a heavy price.

Her mother had always been a dreamer, chasing illusions of love and a past that could never be regained. Like a tavern in the desert, she was enchanted by mirages and lived a life plagued by unquenchable thirst. But Odette knew the value of life, and she knew the importance of money as the foundation of it. She was not willing to sacrifice her honor and self-respect for wealth, but she also knew that honor and self-respect could not take precedence over survival. And so, with a heavy heart, Odette closed her eyes to the meaningless memories and opened them again, her resolve completely firm.

A pension was at stake in this marriage, and Odette desperately needed the funds. And so, she set forth on the path she had reluctantly chosen, her eyes meeting the man as she passed the imperial coat of arms that adorned the hall. It was a decision made out of necessity, but Odette held onto her dignity and honor as she moved forward.

The melody of the spring night flowed like a soothing symphony, illuminating the darkness with a feast of lights. The sweet scent of spring flowers was carried by the breeze that whispered through the garden, creating an enchanting ambiance. It was an evening ball, just like the stories her mother had told her, but Odette knew it was just a one-night mirage, and she did not believe in illusions.

Bastian walked across the grand hall and stopped a small distance away. His attitude towards Odette's chaperone was impeccably polite. Odette waited with elegance for the next turn. As expected, CountessTrier handed her over to Bastian, who approached her without hesitation and offered his hand.

 "Let's go, Lady Odette," he said, his voice commanding and confident, overwhelming the commotion around them.  Odette, raising her slightly lowered eyes, conveyed her permission by offering her hand.

The moment Bastian wrapped his hand around hers, the door to the great banquet hall opened wide, revealing the emperor's seat.





“Please calm down.”

Valerie let out a long sigh, her voice a gentle whisper. Isabelle, her glass held in disappointment, slowly lifted her head to meet her sister's gaze. "I don't need your advice," Isabelle said, her voice tinged with frustration.

"I understand, but how long will you tarnish the honor of the imperial family for a man who has no interest in you?" Valerie asked, her voice filled with concern.

"And who are you to give me this lecture? You were the one chasing after Duke Herhardt not too long ago," Isabelle retorted.

"He is Herhardt, the greatest aristocrat in the empire. You can't compare him to the grandson of a lowly antique dealer," Valerie said, her voice stern.

"Don't speak about Bastian like that!" Isabelle exclaimed, her voice rising in passion. The guests on the terrace, startled by the commotion, all turned their attention to the two princesses.

"Calm down, will you!" Valerie said, her voice firm but gentle. "Have you already forgotten our mother's request for us to show a sense of responsibility worthy of imperial princesses?" Valerie looked around, her cheeks burning with shame at the attention they were getting. But Isabelle was only consumed by her unrequited love, struggling to tame her emotions.

“There's a wonderful time going on between them two, while my sister is crying in the corner.” Valerie let out a sigh again, her voice filled with disdain as she pointed proudly through the terrace window. Isabelle's face twisted in pain as she followed her sister's gaze. Captain Klauswitz and the daughter of Duke Dyssen, their tall and striking figures standing out in the crowd as they laughed and conversed intimately. It was hard to deny that they made a perfect pair, at least in terms of appearance.

"Bastian is just following the emperor's orders," Isabelle muttered, trying to deny the reality her eyes were witnessing in front of her as she drained her cup. But as she watched, the unimaginable happened. The daughter of Duke Dissen whispered something and Bastian tilted his head and lowered his gaze, their eyes and smiles filled with a warmth that spoke of something deeper like a love poem.

"The fact remains the same regardless of your beliefs." Valerie taunted Isabelle cruelly. "Captain Klauswitz fell in love with  lady Dyssen. Obviously, no decent man would turn down such a beautiful woman.”

"You know nothing. Bastian isn't a naive," Isabelle retorted, her eyes opening determinedly as she shook her head firmly.

Six years have passed. She had solely focused on Bastian from the day she experienced love at first sight. How could she have been unaware of the man she had devotedly loved for so many years? It was never just a selfish illusion.

Isabelle was aware despite whatever she heard of people’s opinions.  How loyal and decent man Bastian Klauswitz was.

As Isabelle sat alone on the terrace, the weight of her unreciprocated love pressed heavily upon her heart, aching deeply. The sound of her filling her glass with wine was the only thing that broke the silence of the sorrowful spring night.

She couldn't help but wonder, how deep and sad was this love that she couldn't keep hidden? How could the man she loved have chosen to sacrifice his devotion to the empire for the sake of a woman of a lower class? It was unjust, but that foolishly loyal man seemed to have accepted even that.

Perhaps, in his mind, he was using that woman as a shield to protect the princess's honor. The rumors spreading in the social world were enough to cover Isabelle's name and attract public attention. She sobbed, knowing that the main characters of this social season were already occupied by a hero of low bloodline and an abandoned princess's daughter.

But what did the glory that you paid for with your sacrifice mean?

Isabelle's scarlet cheeks were wet as tears continued to flow and race in a torrent of sadness. Through the open window, a lovely waltz music could now be heard. Bastian, holding the beautiful woman's hand, was one of the visitors that made their way to the dining hall's center in pairs.

 Isabelle poured another glass of wine, her heart ached with a deep and bitter sadness. Her tears flowed like a stream of water, blurring her vision and soaking her hands, but she had no energy left to care about such trifles.

For the first time, she understood her mother's true intentions in allowing her to attend the ball. She must have hoped that Isabelle would be hurt in the most painful way possible, so that she would finally let go of her love.

Isabelle lifted her gaze, her eyes clouded with tears, and looked at her cousin, who had taken the side of Bastian, the man who should have been hers. The woman, said to be a puppet of the imperial family for money, was disgustingly calm and self-assured, and to Isabelle’s dismay, she was also the most beautiful.

As the waltz of the spring night began, Isabelle felt a sense of shame wash over her, sadness turned to a sorrowful weeping, the night only brought unforgiving pain. 


Chapter 11.

Ratty Situation.



The music of the waltz, led by the graceful and confident steps of Bastian Klauswitz, flowed like a melody on a spring night. His movements were effortless and precise, every step taken with the utmost precision and poise. 

Odette stared in amazement at his skill, almost expecting to stumble or falter, but to her surprise, he seemed to glide effortlessly across the dance floor. His demeanor was calm and composed like always, almost haughty in its confidence as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Though it was a little embarrassing to see him so self-assured, Odette quickly regained her composure and moved gracefully alongside him in the dance. The waltz was a perfect representation of the beauty of spring, and the two dancers were its embodiment.

The music swirled around them as Bastian and Odette danced the waltz. The movement of their bodies was as graceful as the notes of the violin, and their steps were in perfect harmony.

As they glided across the dance floor, Odette got severly impressed by Bastian's skill. "You waltz’s very well," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the music.

Bastian chuckled, spreading a hint of amusement in his eyes. "Laven's teachers will be able to make even a monkey do a gentleman's dance," he replied, the words rolling off his tongue with ease.

Odette's eyes widened in surprise. Laven was known to be the most prestigious private school in the empire, where even the children of the most affluent families struggled to gain entry. It was an unlikely name to come from the mouth of a man who was looked down upon for his humble origins.

As the dance came to an end, Odette couldn't shed the feeling of confusion. This was the first and last ball she would ever attend, and she didn't want to leave with the regret of having danced a clumsy dance on such a beautiful night. She pushed the thoughts out of her mind and focused on the present, enjoying the last moments of the waltz before it came to an end.

Odette freely gave Bastian her confidence after making up her resolve to follow him, and he expertly guided her. She hadn't danced a waltz since her mother died, yet her body didn't appear to have forgotten the tight instructions of those earlier days.

The two of them eventually developed a natural flow like a wind tide. Odette permitted herself to relax. 

The emperor and empress sat in their throne-like chairs, pleased with the events that had unfolded before them. Meanwhile, Isabelle retreated to the terrace, tears streaming down her face. And there’s Sandrine de Laviere, or Countess Lenart, who watched the scene with a keen eye, her gaze constantly flitting back and forth.

Bastian, in the meantime, amazed by the ripples Odette had caused with her presence. Everything was going according to plan and even more than he had hoped for. Franz, his step brother, couldn't take his eyes off of Odette. Even as he danced with his fiancée, his gaze was locked on the young woman. The Countess Klein's daughter saw this and cried, but Franz seemed not to notice anything except for Lady of Dissen. 

Smiling to himself, Bastian cast his gaze over Odette. She was so embarrassed that she had to turn away, but even while doing so she maintained a perfectly balanced posture. She was light on her feet and moved fluidly and with a sense of grace.

Bastian didn't appear to care that this night out would permanently ruin Odette's reputation. Dressed to the nines in fine jewelry and a flashy outfit, she had come here appearing to be an independent woman who wouldn't even drink a cup of tea for free, but in the end, she caved to her pompous greed. 

She was obviously capable of comprehending the nature of the company. She wasn't a naive lady who would fall into the pit of her own lyrical vanity, which was lucky in a way.

Each of them needed to use the other for their personal benefit in order to achieve their target and goals.

Bastian's gaze moved over to her smooth ivory cheekbones and beautiful eyes before stopping at the nape of her neck, where her blue veins were plainly apparent. His eyes were assaulted by the radiance of a stunning diamond necklace that could not have belonged to this woman.

Deep above the neckline of her fan dress, Bastian's sight, which had been fixed on the line of light flowing over her straight collarbone, froze. The gown appeared to be poorly fitted for the woman's physique, gravitating special attention to the her breasts. Clothespins had been used to cinch in her waist, but there didn't seem to be enough time to loosen them again.

As the music of the waltz flowed gracefully through the grand ballroom, Odette found herself in the arms of the infamous Captain Bastian Klauswitz. He stood tall and proud, his piercing blue eyes fixed upon her as if she were a precious treasure to be kept and hide.

"What a beautiful piece of jewelry and dress," he murmured, his lips curling into a sly smile. Again, he studied the contours of her body, this time with an interest in the color her undergarments she was wearing. Odette felt a flush rise to her cheeks as she tried to pull away, but his arms held her close, as if she were caged, making it impossible for her to escape.

"Thank you for the compliment, Captain," she responded firmly, trying to mask the flutter of nerves in her chest. 

"Are you returning it after tonight?" he asked, his voice heavy with sarcasm. Odette could feel the heat of his breath on her cheek as he leaned in closer, his gaze intense and unyielding.

Despite her discomfort, Odette couldn't help but be drawn to the captivating allure of this dangerous man. The shadows cast by the flickering lights on his sharp features only served to accentuate his handsome, mysterious demeanor. As the waltz continued, Odette knew she was trapped in his arms, and she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being pulled deeper and deeper into a dangerous game.

Even though it was indecent language, Odette made the choice not to call it out. He graduated from the Royal Military Academy and the esteemed history department before being commissioned as an officer. His education was more aristocratic than that of any other aristocrat. Furthermore, it implied that Bastian Klauswitz's harshness  was not due to a lack of education.

“Yes. Because I rented it for a day's worth of my pay." Odette met Bastian's gaze with a renewed sense of confidence, the shame that had previously weighed heavily on her now lifted. "I have nothing to hide from you, Captain," she thought to herself. "Don't worry too much, I have enough money left to make other arrangements," she said with a hint of defiance in her voice.

Bastian raised an eyebrow, impressed. "Lady Odette, you are a much wealthier woman than I had imagined."

"It's all thanks to your generosity, Captain," Odette responded with a sly smile.

"Generosity?" Bastian queried, intrigued.

"Yes, your consideration has saved me a great deal of money on tea," Odette replied, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.

Bastian chuckled at her clever retort, understanding the playful jab at their previous encounter. "Well played, Lady Odette," he said with a grin. Though it seemed her revenge had not quite achieved the desired result, Odette couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at besting him no matter a small way.

As they danced, Bastian couldn't help but marvel at the beauty that stood before him. The way the jewels on Odette's dress glimmered in the light, and the way her hair cascaded down her shoulders, it was as if she were a goddess sent to grace him with her presence.

"It's fortunate that the tea money is being spent on something far more valuable than the Duke's gamble," Bastian said, his voice low and smooth.

Odette raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips. "Since it's the money I was supposed to pay the captain, I'm going to use it for the captain's benefits," she said, a hint of mischief in her voice.

Bastian giggled. "Next time, I'll have to treat you to a nice meal. So that the lady can save more money."

But Odette shook her head. "I'm sorry, but I am going to decline that offer," she said, her voice firm.

"Why?" Bastian asked, his brows furrowed in confusion.

"I don't want to go into debt that I can't afford to pay off." 

Bastian scoffed, a smirk on his lips. "I would never by any chance have to sell such a noble woman in exchange for a debt,"

"Considering the memory of the first day I met Captain, I don't believe it very much," Odette said, her words a gentle tease.

And as they danced, lost in their banter and playful jabs, Bastian couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for the woman before him. She was strong and independent, and she had a neck that was as long and slender as a swan's. As the night deepened and the lights grew brighter, Bastian knew that this would be a night that imprinted in his mind’s eyes forever, that he would never forget, no matter what. 

In their light-tinted eyes, they continued to dance together.

Odette occasionally turned her head away, hitherto Bastian stared calmly and deeply anyway. The noise from the other side of the hall only became audible to them toward the end of the dance. Bastian looked in the direction of the muttering. Among the guests, who had stopped dancing in shock, was a stumbling woman. 

It was Princess Isabelle, the culprit responsible for staging this this wedding charade.



“There you are!”

The piercing cry echoed through the grand ballroom, causing all eyes to turn towards the commotion. In the midst of the chaos, the princess stormed in, wedging herself between Odette and Bastian.

With a venomous sneer, Isabelle glared at Odette, her voice filled with disdain. "I know you're just trying to escape your lowly life. You're nothing but a beggar, with no shred of dignity."

Fury burning in her eyes, Isabelle lunged towards Odette, her words filled with malice. "This woman is just using you for your money. She's nothing but a common prostitute!"

With a fierce tug, Isabelle yanked the ornamental comb from Odette's hair and cast it aside. She wrenched Odette's hair with a violent clutch, causing her to cry out in pain. Bastian's lips twisted into a twisted sneer as he watched, admiring Isabelle's audacity to attack Odette with such ferocity despite her drunken state.

"Behold that haughty one, still blinded by the glitter of jewels! Can you believe it?" Isabelle said in disgust. 

Bastian stepped forward, his strong arms shielding Odette as she collected the shattered pieces of her comb. Isabelle, fueled by drunken anger, raged on, but Bastian's calm presence seemed to quell her fury. He spoke soothing words to the princess, trying to bring her back to reason, but she was beyond listening.

"You are drunk." Bastian abruptly halted Isabelle's actions.

"Bastian, I love you. I absolutely love you so much "The princess muttered, her eyes lifeless and hazy, and it was obvious that she had consumed too much alcohol.  Isabelle sobbed and threw her arms around Bastian, "I would rather let the whole world know of my love for you than to lose you like this."

 Tears streaming down her face, Isabelle clung to Bastian, pouring out her love for him in a desperate confession. The smell of alcohol on her breath was overwhelming.  Bastian gently pushed her away, his eyes filled with a mix of pity and disgust.  But Isabelle was desperate, clinging to him like a person on the brink of falling. Her neck, chin, and lower lip pressed against his in random, drunken kisses.

They didn't know what to do and feared that the immodest scene would ignite a fire. It wasn't much different for Franz, who was keeping an eye on his fiance's family like a lost bird.

Bastian turned his head to avoid the unwanted advances, his eyes falling on the imperial throne where a commotion was taking place, as the Empress had collapsed from shock.

As the imperial couple made their hasty exit, the orchestra fell silent, and the once vibrant banquet hall was left in a cold, oppressive silence. The spring ball at the palace had come to an inglorious end, and the guests were left to contemplate the chaos that Isabelle had wrought.

Bastian's eyes scanned the room, taking in the panicked expressions of the guests, the empress's collapsed form. He smiled, a small, quiet smile at the absurdity of it all. He caught the eye of his father, who looked at him with anger and disappointment, yet he gave a small nod of understanding.

And then he turned his head again, his gaze falling on Isabelle, who was still clinging to him, her face a mess of tears and smudged makeup. It was a tragic scene, one that was both heart-wrenching and elegant. In that moment, Bastian couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment, as if he were watching a play, and the characters were nothing more than actors on a stage. The play ended in an elegant tragedy.




Chapter 12.

Blue Blood.



"Perhaps I've lived a little too long."

As Countess Trier surveyed the chaos that had unfolded before her, she felt a sense of despair wash over her. The sight of Princess Isabelle lashing out at Bastian Klauswitz in such a manic manner was truly horrifying. It was as if she had been witness to a scene straight out of a nightmare. Despite her best efforts, the Countess found it difficult to keep her eyes open, as the events before her seemed too much to bear.

With a cold, disdainful gaze, the antique dealer's grandson, Bastian, looked upon the imperial princess Isabelle. His lack of respect for the royal family was palpable, as he dared to show his true feelings towards the princess without any regard for protocol. 

Countess Trier, watching the scene with growing concern, couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as she feared that Bastian might take dire actions against the princess. But as she watched, Bastian let out a deep sigh and firmly pushed the princess away, refusing to give her any further mercy.

"Isabelle!" The princess broke into tears at the sound of the Crown Prince's voice, she knew was once again rejected by Bastian Klauswitz.

The prince appeared and took Isabelle's hand, dragging her away from the chaotic scene as Bastian tidied up his disheveled clothing, his actions seeming dismissive and callous. Isabelle's heart got heavy with grief and despair.

"Somehow, Princess Helene is much more better. At least she wouldn't have embarrassed herself like that," an older member of the imperial family murmured in a contemplative tone, her voice low and hushed.

When the banquet drew to a close, amidst a flurry of sharp words, the Duke of Dyssen was acknowledged as a nobleman of distinction. Yet, many were left to ponder how the fair Princess Isabelle could have been so easily beguiled by one of lesser standing, such as Bastian. However, the esteemed Captain Klauswitz, with his impressive wealth and abilities, was deemed a far superior match. Despite the end of the feast, the guests lingered, unwilling to depart the heated discussion.

As the princess departed, Captain Klauswitz and the elegant Lady Odette remained behind. Countess Trierr’s  attention fixed upon the antique dealer's grandson conversing with the returning crown prince, cast a glance towards Odette, who stood resolute in her original position. The torn fabric of the child's dress and disheveled hair spoke of a sorrowful tale, etched upon their countenance.Odette turned around just as the Countess of Trier's heart became infinitely heavy. At the same time, Bastian did the same after finishing his conversation with the crown prince.

Their gazes encountered again,  in the tranquil brilliant light of the imperial palace.



Her black hair fluttered down like waves of ocean this night. Bastian only realized what was happening in front of him. He took a deep breath.

Odette took off her hair tie. She ran her long slender fingers through her messy hair, pulling out pins one by one. At first glance, the woman's slow and smooth movements appeared like a romantic dance.

Bastian narrowed his eyes as he observed the bizarre scene. Odette came to face him directly, her neatly arranged hair falling down one shoulder. The princess's ruined dress and the traces of her fingernails on her skin were barely concealed. Countless onlookers were still staring at her, but she seemed to have forgotten about it all. No, she was under the strange impression that nothing had happened since the beginning.

With her dress restored to its former glory, Odette approached Bastian with a steady and regal gait. The sound of her footsteps echoed and reverberated through the grand halls like a proud queen. Bastian's gaze was filled with both interest and doubt as he watched her approach.

Up close, Odette's face was as pale as porcelain, and it seemed as though she might faint at any moment. However her upright posture reminded Bastian of their first meeting. This woman, who had been sold by her father to pay his gambling debts, had always held her head high, even under the roof of the imperial palace. Now, she stood before him, her spirit unaffected, and a trustworthiness undeniable.

Odette surveyed her surroundings. With a face devoid of expression.  The grand marble hall, the serene night garden, and the magnificent Bastian. She lowered her head in awe, realizing that she had managed to maintain her composure despite the shame and humiliation she had endured. Bastian knew instantly what this gesture meant.

Odette requested that the unfinished waltz be completed. A polite request or a haughty command? It was absurd in either case.

Bastian raised the corner of his mouth, slightly depressed.

The grand banquet hall was alight with the glimmer of blue blood as the Emperor’s princess was dragged out, her actions having sullied the honor of the imperial family. The elite of society had gathered, their interest piqued by the scandal of adultery and murder of his stepmother, the aristocratic wife of her father. He finally understood the true weight of the phrase, ‘Blue Blood’ and wondered what could have driven her to such madness.

Bastian took a careful look around and returned his gaze to Odette. He bowed his head towards the woman who was insignificant more than anyone else in this place, carrying the blood that flowed the thickest and bluest through her veins stubbornly.

The crowd, held in a suspended state of shock, began to stir as the spectacle before them unfolded. A behavior so brazen and unbecoming, it seemed almost as if the party was still in full swing, despite the disgrace that hung heavy in the air. Countess Trier, her initial reluctance to bring Odette to light now a distant memory, watched on with a cryptic smile etched upon her lips, as she whispered to herself, ‘what the hell is this?’

As the final notes of the waltz played, the couple gracefully glided across the floor, their intertwined hands leading the way. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, as if by magic, allowing the duo to make their grand exit.

"Tell me, my dear Bastian, did you find pleasure in the company of the fair Odette?" The Countess of Trier's words were like honey on the tongue, but with a hint of mischief in her eyes.

Bastian smiled as he replied, "It was a privilege to spend this momentous occasion with such a radiant lady."

For the first time in his life, he had stepped foot inside the grand halls of the imperial palace, and the experience was nothing short of breathtaking.

The Countess studied him intently, taking in the young officer before her.

Rumors of his subservience, of sacrificing his pride for the sake of his ambition and wealth, preceded him. But as she looked upon him, she saw something else - a man armored in confidence, with the air of one who had never known servitude. She could understand how some might be taken in by his fierce light, yet it did not change the fact that the princess was unwell.

"I'll see you later, Captain." Countess Trier accepted Odette's hand with a dubious greeting. Odette trembled. Her small exhaled breath also sounded erratic.

Bastian, paid tribute to the chaperone, turned around while the Countess of Trier was stunned. The antique dealer's grandson, aware of Odette's condition did not even raise an eyebrow, left astounded.

Which of the two ?Odette, who stood firm and refused to give in to the situation, or Bastian, who was willing to sympathize with her?  Was the more terrifying of the two?

They were obviously too similar rivals.

"Helene has done a good job of raising her kid. Despite having poor eyes for men, she seems to have been a terrific mother." Countess Trier offered words of encouragement, with a gentle smile to match. She even withdrew her hand when she went to call for someone. "Bravo, my dear. You were flawless."

Odette's eyes shone with a mix of relief, joy and a tinge of sadness as she heard the Countess's words.

"Thank you, Countess." The rich emotions that glimmered with unshed tears in her eyes soon dissipated as she replied with a calm demeanor and a hint of a quivering smile.

Without a word, Countess Trier guided Odette away, knowing that what the young woman needed now was a much-needed respite.



“Yes. I'm going to trust your word on this.” Admiral Demel let out a deep sigh and spoke in a hushed tone, a decision reached after much deliberation about Bastian's association with the Princess.

"Keep a low profile for now. It couldn't hurt to cozy up to Lady Odette."  Admiral Demel left the banquet hall with a request that felt almost like a threat, hinting to take advantage of the woman. It was clear what his true intentions were.

From then on, several nagging thoughts kept creeping in and out of Bastian's mind. Eventually, when he left the banquet hall, the night fell. If it were like last year, the ball would be in full swing, but tonight, the Imperial Palace was heavy with a sense of emptiness.

As Bastian settled into the car and closed his eyes, sinking back into the seat. He let out a tired sigh and undid his bow tie, the knot coming undone with ease.  He reflected on the events of the day, it dawned on him that perhaps the performance of the play for the Emperor should be extended. It seemed that it would take a long time for the aftermath of today’s incident to dissipate.

When he opened his eyes, solidifying his resolve, the car was passing through the bustling streets of Lutz, the night view of the Reinfeld Hotel coming into view through the car window. And with that, the memory of Odette came flooding back to him.

She had stood tall and resolute, refusing to back down, her poise and grace masking the inner turmoil that was surely brewing beneath the surface.

Just as she had done that night, when she had donned her veil once more, straightened her posture, and went out of the seedy gaming den with poise. Bastian closed his eyes shut for a while, letting go of the memory of her hair cascading down her neck, the soft white nape exposed.

The wind blew through the half-open car window, rustling the leaves of the trees. And with that, the flower petals that had been caught on Bastian's collar for a while, disappeared quietly into the gray night.

Chapter 13.

She Has Found Love?



The proprietor of the quaint grocery store rose from behind the counter, his voice echoing with authority. An unpleasant odor seeped from his lips as he spoke, suffocating the air around him.

"Bring me the money, don't talk crap!"

Duke Dyssen recoiled, his expression contorting in revulsion. In this dingy and impoverished neighborhood, being forced to feign amiability with this newly-arrived merchant was an unendurable burden, but he had no choice.

Ever since that fateful day when he became embroiled with the misfortune-ridden officers of the Navy, Duke found it increasingly challenging to even step foot in the clandestine gambling dens of the back alleys.

With the pension he got from the Imperial family, he should have been able to accumulate enough funds to acquire a respectable abode, but his last shred of hope rested solely on the gaming tables in the seedy outskirts, surrounded by the dregs of society.

 "Pray, grant me entrance to the premises just once more. I shall then bestow the portion of my winnings."

"Good heavens! You are penniless and still cling to the grandiose dream of recouping your debts." The grocer chuckled, his dingy teeth on full display, inciting the group of men who were horrified puffing on their cigarettes to join in the laughter.

"Not here. Go, give your daughter a visit. I have heard rumors of her securing the affections of a gentleman. Perhaps you might retrieve some pocket money from him." The barber spoke, offering a preposterous suggestion.

"Odette has found love? Such tales are nothing but fabrications," Duke Dieyssen protested.

"You are unaware that your daughter is a prostitute. How pitiful," someone jeered.

"Insult my daughter again, and you will witness to my wrath!" Duke Dyssen warned, his voice echoing with anger.

"Why does she don her finest attire and roam the night, if not for a purpose?"

"Not long ago, I peered from my luxurious carriage into the night, and I spotted a figure of wealth and affluence."

"If only we could have a chance to cash in before he rises to the top."

"Listen, Duke of Beggary. If you seek to participate in the next competition, why not bring your daughter along? They may extend to you a gracious discount."

Their grins shimmered with maleficence as they traded jests and made lewd gestures.

Duke Dyssen, his face aflame with anger, vented his frustration by lashing out at a wooden chest stacked near the entrance. The sound of shattering glass bottles echoed amidst the cries of the stunned onlookers.

"You scoundrels! How dare you talk about someone's daughter like that!" he bellowed. Duke Dyssen stormed out of the grocery store, his mind awhirl with frustration and anger. He thought of the tin mine that had promised wealth, but instead brought nothing but despair. The loss of his wife, the emperor's wrath, and the betrayal of his daughter weighed heavily on him.

He cursed the fraudulent seller who had sold him the mine and the callous members of the imperial family who had stripped his daughter of her title and banished her. The Duke had hoped to restore his family's standing by marrying his daughter to the emperor's son, but those dreams were shattered.

Fleeing to a foreign land to escape the emperor's wrath, they returned home only after the death of the previous emperor, who had shown mercy and offered them a place to live and settlement money. Though the Duke's aspirations for restoration were not fulfilled, he was grateful for the emperor's kindness.

Helen slumped and died in anguish, shocked to find she had lost all the money. Even though his sister's passing was the result of a tragic accident, the emperor held the Duke responsible. Indeed, He shared his father's heartlessness.

With Odette, there was a ray of hope that things could yet alter in the future.

Once more feeling upbeat, the Duke of Dyssen folded his cloak's collar. Odette was waiting for him when he turned the corner and gazed.

Odette emerged from the building's door where the rental home was housed, well-dressed. The Duke of Dyssen quickly hid himself between the gaps in the little building after deciding against summoning his daughter.

Odette's outings had, it occurred to him, been happening more frequently lately. It seems that she had experienced pleasant things that he had never witnessed before. A very odd change had occurred.

As he came to that realization in his thinking, he experienced a foreboding sensation. 

How could she...

when he attempted to dismiss his disturbing feeling, Odette got a little bit closer. With his back to the wall, Duke Dyssen positioned close by. Fortunately, Odette did not glance in that direction. She headed for a bridge that crossed the Prater River. It was a street corner in the middle of the city that led to the downtown.

After giving it some thought, Duke Dyssen moved as quietly as a shadow to follow his daughter.



"A warm greeting and many thanks for your gracious invitation, Countess," Odette began with an air of graciousness.

With a piercing gaze, Countess Trier, set aside her glass of water, scrutinized Odette's appearance. Despite her modest attire resembling that of a governess, Odette managed to carry herself with a tolerable elegance, choosing to avoid ostentatiousness. A common misconception amongst men was that beauty equates to attraction.

"Have I met your expectations?" Odette queried with a hint of mischief playing at the corners of her lips, her facial expression otherwise emotionless.

"Barely avoiding a failing grade," the Countess replied with a twinkle in her eye, gesturing for Odette to take a seat at the table across from her. Odette's poised movements, full of grace, belied her humble origins and momentarily made her forget her financial struggles.

Her lineage was rich with memories of splendor, and she was the embodiment of the fading remnants of their former glory.

The conversation at the table was light and inconsequential, discussing trivialities like the whimsical spring weather, headaches, and a subpar opera performance from the previous weekend.

A round of appetizers were served as they idly chatted away.

 Countess Trier, impatiently awaiting her order, glanced around the restaurant. A parade of elegantly dressed guests flowed in and out, but her desired arrival was yet to be seen.

With a hint of surprise in her voice, Odette broached the topic of the missing comb.  Countess Trier cast a sideways glance at her, noticing the genuine concern etched on her features.

"How quaint of you to still fret over a mere trinket, despite the recent affront," the Countess remarked with a wry laugh.

"I apologize, Countess, for not properly safeguarding your property," Odette replied, her voice sincere.

The Countess raised a skeptical brow. "I have little patience for insincere pleasantries, my dear."

"If it pleases the Countess, I will reimburse you for the damages," Odette offered.

The Countess arched a brow, amused. "And how exactly do you plan on accomplishing that?"

"I will take it up with His Majesty, the Emperor," Odette replied matter-of-factly.

The Countess let out a sharp laugh, realizing that Odette was no different from her father, the Duke, in cunning and tenacity.

"Are you proposing to bill the Emperor for his daughter's misdeeds?" The Countess asked, with a hint of amusement in her voice.

"Yes, for it was undoubtedly Princess Isabelle's fault," Odette replied with a resolute nod.

"Do you truly believe the Emperor will heed your request?" 

"Even if he holds no regard for me, I believe he will do right by you, the esteemed elder of the imperial family," Odette said,  setting her wine glass down and folded her hands in a neat on her lap. 

Countess Trier could not contain her laughter as she watched her seemingly resolved appearance, as if she had really decided to extract a debt from the emperor. "Indeed, it would be quite troublesome if the Emperor of the Empire cannot rectify the mistakes of his own daughter. I will have the jeweler's estimate of the repair costs sent directly to the Imperial Palace as soon as it arrives."

"Will they be able to fix it?" Odette asked, a glimmer of hope in her eyes.

"Yes, thanks to your diligent collection of the broken pieces," the Countess replied with a warm smile.

Odette let out a sigh of relief, her features softening into a smile that lit up her face. The Countess was momentarily taken aback by the transformation, as the normally stoic young woman now exuded a childlike innocence.

"I am grateful, Countess," Odette said, her smile beaming.

The Countess chose to overlook the sudden change in demeanor, instead opting to view it as a useful tool in capturing the attention of the man, Bastian. Perhaps, she mused, a charmingly naive swan would prove to be a more effective strategy in dealing with him than a wooden statue.

As Countess Trier shared the news of Princess Isabelle's imprisonment at the imperial summer palace, Odette gazed out the window of the restaurant. The once sunny spring days had been replaced by a dreary, cloud-covered street that seemed to hint at the return of winter. 

Suddenly, a luxurious automobile with golden wheels pulled up to the restaurant, interrupting Odette's thoughts.

With a deep breath, Odette turned her attention back to the table. She reminded herself that this meal was simply another task she had been assigned, and she couldn't afford to let her emotions get the better of her. After all, she had learned through a painful past that it was easier to protect her heart if she didn't allow herself to feel too much.

Even the princess's recent outburst at the ball didn't shake Odette's resolve. She knew that her only weapons were her impeccable manners and composed demeanor, and she made sure to double-check her pocket knife before leaving the house. She wasn't here to make friends or get emotionally invested, but to simply play the role of a dinner guest before making her exit.

"Well, my stomach is growling at me now." Countess Trier caught the waiter's eye and signaled for their meal. At that moment, a customer took a seat at the next table.

Odette's gaze landed on a familiar figure, causing her to let out a soft gasp of surprise. The young officer seated diagonally across from her raised a curious eyebrow in response.

"Goodness, what a coincidence, Countess Trier," exclaimed the old gentleman seated across from the officer, who was none other than Admiral Demel, another imperial matchmaker.

"I never thought I'd run into Lord Demel here," the Countess remarked with a look of surprise mirrored on her face. "Why don't we have a meal together? After all, this just happens to be the table next to us."

“If the ladies agree, it would be our pleasure, right?" Admiral Demel said with a friendly smile, looking to the young officer across from him. Bastian, the young officer, was forced to nod in agreement,

“Of course.”  

The final piece to this staged scenario was left to Odette.

"How about it, Odette?" Countess Trier turned her head and asked, her tone relaxed.

Odette lifted her confused gaze, looking at Bastian, who sported a charming smile despite the absurdity of the situation. The man who claimed to follow the emperor's orders was willing to play along with this obvious plan.

"Yes, Countess," Odette said with finality, paying for a delightful lunch with her answer. She couldn't help but remember the warmth of the hand that caught her as she stumbled, and the softness in the eyes that gazed upon her.

But Odette was fully aware that this marriage proposal could never penetrate her heart, for she would never give it away.


Chapter 14.

Spring Snow.





Amidst the bustling Saturday lunch crowd, a table of distinction held the gaze of all. As a sought-after haunt for the wealthy and famous, the clear intention of the meal was palpable. But Bastian was undeterred, becoming a willing player in the matchmakers' game. With grace, he embraced the opportunity to reunite with Odette in the near future, for he saw no reason to decline.

The accident caused by the princess was apparently controlled, but as the days passed, stories gained greater traction. The idea that the tragedy of the previous generation would eventually be repeated was growing. A good number of fools were also gravely frightened that their relationship with Bellof would be shattered as a result of a skewed national marriage.

"April is a really crazy month. When the flowers are in full bloom, winter returns." Admiral Demel gently changed the subject after gushingly praising the compatible duo. "It's unfortunate if the game needs to be postponed due to the weather."

Admiral Demel's gaze met with the aged Countess, and he sighed with a sudden air of gravity. Bastian, keenly attuned to the purpose of their gathering, joined the fray with subtle observation. And so, it was Countess Trier, Odette's chaperone, who made her move.

"It seems there's a significant happening afoot,'’ she remarked.

‘‘Indeed.'’ replied the Admiral, seizing the opportunity. ‘'Next weekend will mark the annual friendly polo match between the Navy and Army. It is a cherished event that promotes camaraderie between the two forces."

“I see. I'm sure I heard about it. Does the Captain take part in the game as well?” Countess Trier questioned Bastian.

"Indeed, Countess." With a discerning understanding of the matchmakers' designs, Bastian offered a fitting response. Odette, dining in silence, finally lifted her gaze, her plate still heaping with uneaten food.

‘'Captain Klauswitz, you see, is a paragon among the Admiralty's players,” the Admiral revealed. “Save for a brief stint on the overseas front, he has been a mainstay in the annual matches and consistently performed admirably.”

'’Ah, he truly is a hero in every sense of the word,'’  Countess Trier said in admiration.

"Yes, his prowess in martial arts and resourcefulness are second to none, and I wouldn't be surprised if he rises to command the fleet in the near future." Admiral Demel added.

Odette gazed upon the untouched remnants of her meal with a pensive frown. She sighed silently before lifting her eyes once more. She noticed the rearrangement of the cutlery and realized that she could not possibly finish the feast before her.

Admiral Demel, meanwhile, was in the midst of his confident conclusion, "I can assure you, he is truly a gem among soldiers, a naval treasure in every sense of the word. But the admiral was unaware that the treasure he spoke of had been overshadowed by the sea bass dish before him.”

 Countess Trier interjected, "And all he needs now is a suitable spouse. At twenty-six, it's time for him to start a family." Her piercing gaze, narrowed like that of a sleepy cat, bore into Bastian, revealing her true, cold emotions.

"Yes, Countess, of course." Admiral Demel let out an awkward chuckle and with a hint of empathy in his voice, he offered, "Lady Odette, if your schedule permits, how about joining us for a thrilling game of polo? I assure you, it will be a most enjoyable experience."

As he addressed Odette, the admiral carried out his duties disguised as a simple invitation. If not for his loyalty to the emperor's wishes, he would have never agreed to this matchmaking scheme.

Despite her impeccable heritage and captivating beauty, the lady lacked substance. For Bastian, the marriage was merely a means to advance his standing, and for the lady, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.

Odette gracefully accepted, "I would be honored to attend if invited."

As Admiral Demel struggled with the weight of his duty to the empire, he was ready to sacrifice one of his dear subordinates.

"Then let it be." A smile of relief graced the Admiral's face as he cast aside his unease and embraced the role assigned to him. The table was cleared and desserts were served as they eagerly looked forward to the approaching weekend.

Admiral Demel ate his dessert with haste, eager to bring an end to this charade. The same could be said for Bastian and the Countess. But Odette, she savored each bite of her barely touched plate in silence.

After the meal, Admiral Demel bid farewell to Countess Trier and left the restaurant, leaving Odette in the care of Bastian.

“Captain Klauswitz, Admiral Demel and I need to talk, so we'd like to have you see Odette off.".” 

With their business concluded, Countess Trier and Admiral Demel made their way towards the waiting carriage. The Admiral, looking pleased with the results of their discussions, gave a nod of farewell to Bastian before following the Countess inside. 

The carriage, emblazoned with gold trim and a cream exterior, carried the two conspirators away, leaving Bastian and Odette in each other's company. The two gazed at each other, their eyes locking as a new chapter of their lives began. And then, with a soft invitation, Bastian led Odette towards a waiting vehicle. "Shall we go?"

Bastian's insensitive face broke into a beautiful smile. Odette nodded her head in agreement and averted her gaze from him.

Bastian escorted Odette and met the waiter who had delivered the automobile. The waltz that evening was as exquisite as the motion of opening and closing the passenger door.

Nowhere could she be escaped at this time.

Odette reiterated that fact as she readied herself. She needed to accept responsibility for her choice. Of sure, it was going to be difficult.

She felt a chill run down her spine, as she realized the road ahead was uncertain and filled with potential heartache. But she remained steadfast, as she had always lived life to the fullest, her spirit unbreakable in the face of adversity.

Bastian stepped into the driver's seat, his demeanor now serious and his expression as cold as the winter sky. As Odette took a deep breath, she knew that she was ready to face whatever the future held.



"Let me know if you've thought of somewhere to go."

Bastian finally broke the silence as their vehicle halted at an intersection. Odette whose gaze fixated on the mayhem of cars swerving out of the opposing lane, turned her head around in surprise

"My understanding on these matters is limited," Odette said,  her voice as gentle as a summer breeze.

“These matters?”

“The things between a guy and a woman,.... if you know what I mean.” with a contemplative expression, Odette graced Bastian with an sincere response. "I'll simply follow the captain's lead," 

A hint of a smile graced Bastian's lips as he regarded her curiously. “Well, I don’t think that’s a very good idea.” he stated, turning his gaze forward once more.

His reply was cryptic, causing Odette to furrow her brow in confusion.

Odette couldn't help but wonder if she had misinterpreted his words. The train chugged along the tracks, the sound of the wheels clacking a soothing background as she delved deeper into her thoughts.

She rode in a carriage or streetcar, so she was not accustomed to the view of the city from this vantage point.

"I believe a location with lots of eyes would be ideal if it's a meeting to disseminate rumors."

As the vehicle glided onto the elegant Preve Boulevard, Odette's mind raced with possibilities until she stumbled upon the perfect solution. Amidst the shimmering lights of high-end boutiques and grand hotels, the city was awash in a soft, cloudy glow.

"Well, that seems to be the most practical approach," Bastian agreed readily, his gaze taking in the vibrant downtown landscape.

The Opera House loomed ahead, its majestic facade lit up in the gathering dusk. Despite the early hour, the performance would soon commence, making it near impossible to secure a coveted seat.

The Department Store bustled with activity, a sea of faces blending together in the throngs of shoppers. It was difficult to stand out amidst the crowds.

Finally, Bastian's gaze landed on a grand Hotel, its regal facade beckoning. Yet, he knew that becoming embroiled with this delicate creature was not an option.

The automobile pulled up to Preve Boulevard's intersection while he checked each choice off his list one by one. The location was where the two museums faced one another.

"Are you a fan of paintings?" Bastian squinted his eyes as he turned to face the Art History Museum. The building's façade was covered with a sizable poster advertising a special show. A gathering spot for bored women with excess money and free time, it wasn't a bad setting though

With a studied gaze, Odette quietly voiced her approval. “……Yes. I like it.”

Nodding in agreement, Bastian guided the vehicle towards their destination with confident ease. Grand carriages and luxurious automobiles dotted the parking lot, basking in the splendor of the surrounding building.

Though the back entrance was closer, Bastian chose to lead Odette to the more conspicuous front door, a decision that would not go unnoticed. As they approached the steps of the Art History Museum, Odette suddenly came to a halt, her previously cooperative demeanor giving way to wonder.

A gentle smile lit up her features as she gazed skyward, and Bastian soon figured out the reason for her delight. Snowflakes were drifting down, mingling amongst the blooming branches.

Though spring in Ratz was known for its erratic weather, the sight of the snow-covered sky seemed to enrapture Odette, her expression dreamy. Bastian couldn't help but ponder the age of this enigmatic woman.

A snowflake landed on Odette's eyelashes as Bastian went over the memories he had forgotten.

Odette appeared much gentler and younger than usual when she blinked in astonishment.

As Bastian stood in the falling snow, his thoughts turned to Odette, who seemed so fragile and vulnerable. In that moment, it felt like a fleeting thought, as ephemeral as a snowflake before it melts away, much like the petals of a flower carried off by the winds of spring.

Though he had initially seen her presence as a hindrance, Bastian came to realize that it was also an unexpected blessing. Through her, he was able to fully immerse himself in this world and neutralize the ticking time bomb that was the princess.

The marriage business would greatly benefit from having Odette's name. She was undoubtedly a woman of noble standing and pedigree, even if she had to reach rock bottom to get from one location to another. It would be preferable if Bastian Klauswitz's marriage to such a partner became part of his name-value-increasing history.

He would happily exploit her till the day she was no longer useful.

Odette tilted her head as Bastian reached a firm conclusion. Her long, thick eyelashes framed her big, beautiful eyes. Tentative curiosity or hazy apprehension. In any case, it was a feeling out of character for a lady who was selling herself to escape the pit.

As the exhibition came to a close, a bevy of noble ladies stepped out into the open air. With a smooth and practiced motion, Bastian doffed his officer's cap, revealing his countenance to all. He then offered his arm to Odette, escorting her up the grand steps of the Art History Museum, where the gaze of onlookers soon settled upon them.


Chapter 15.

The Peaceful Presence of Beautiful Things.





The grand hall of the Art History Museum was abuzz with a gathering of onlookers, resembling a swarm of bees that had discovered their blooms eager to hear the news whispered from ear to ear. The star of the show, however, was an unlikely pair - the grandson of an antique dealer and the daughter of a forsaken princess, two souls brought together by fate, and yet deemed mismatched by the emperor. 

They glided from one exhibit to the next, entranced by the beauty before them, their silence only serving to enhance the allure of their tender connection. To the casual observer, they appeared as affectionate lovers, yet to another, they seemed like perfect strangers, their enigmatic bond defying explanation.

The onlookers had forgotten even the most basic form of discretion as they were now shamelessly glancing at the two while still engrossed in the enigmatic puzzle. The couple maintained their snobbish posture despite being aware of the stinging glances they were receiving.

As the pair made their way through the galleries, the gathered onlookers reached a quiet consensus. Despite this, it was difficult to discern whether his heart was set on a clandestine escape with the princess or if he was deeply enamored with the Duke of Dyssen's daughter. The air of mystery only fueled the spectators' intrigue, causing a hushed buzz to ripple through the room.

 And just as the room was awash with curious excitement, the grandson of the antique dealer turned his head, causing a barely noticeable stir that echoed through the halls. The truth remained elusive, shrouded in the shadows of speculation.



Odette was completely absorbed in the exhibition.

He initially brushed it off as a showy display, but at this point he was forced to acknowledge the woman's genuineness.

Bastian cast his eager gaze over the paintings and sculptures, his attention captivated by the woman beside him. Odette, her eyes fixed on the pamphlet she had brought from the entrance, explored the works with the unbridled excitement of an art student. Her demeanor was calm and focused, but her eyes would occasionally crinkle with curiosity, a faint smile playing at her lips as she found the answers she sought within the pages. And when uncertainty still lingered, she would tilt her head, a reflection of her thirst for knowledge.

As they entered the final exhibition room, traditional paintings, mainly nudes with classical and mythological themes, surrounded them. Odette approached a painting at the far end of the hall, completely absorbed in her exploration, seemingly oblivious to Bastian's presence.

Undeterred, Bastian followed closely behind, keeping a respectful distance. Through the window, the streets of Ratz were blanketed in a gentle layer of spring snow, a picturesque scene that rivaled the beauty within the exhibition hall.

Bastian suddenly thought, looking across the square at the Natural History Museum, "I’m glad we didn't go there." He had no interest in the themes either, so it wasn't much different from the other museums; nonetheless, this place offered something more enjoyable than gazing at fossils and botanical displays.

With purpose in his steps, Bastian closed the gap between him and Odette, his movements fluid and graceful. Amongst the still beauty of the exhibitions, she seemed to blend into the landscape, a part of the very essence of the art around her.

"This exhibition hall is well worth the investment," Bastian declared as he approached the final piece.

Startled by the sudden sound of his voice, Odette raised her head, her gaze falling upon the serious expression on Bastian's face. Gone was the lighthearted humor she had come to expect from him, replaced by a contemplative air that left her momentarily stunned.

But Odette's surprise was short-lived, her calm gaze soon giving way to a smile that was at once both guarded and disarmingly genuine. Bastian's own lips curled in response, the shadows cast by their smiling eyes deepening the reverent hush that enveloped them.

"It seems that even the renowned teachers of Laven, who taught the captain to dance like a gentleman, failed to impart a truly gentlemanly appreciation for art,"  Odette said

" I speak as one who was nurtured by the teachings of Laven's esteemed instructors." 

“Are you attempting to dishonor your alma mater?”

"If you take a look at the pictures the gents of Laven have stuck on the dormitory closet door, you will see that I am right." Bastian replied with a gentle smile, as he cast his gaze over the numerous works on display. The grand display of nudes, surrounded by glittering frames, was certainly impressive, but it paled in comparison to the classical masterpieces they had marveled at earlier.

"Might the captain have been among those who adorned their dormitory doors with such nude paintings?" Odette queried, fixing Bastian with a penetrating gaze.

“What do you assume?” Bastian cocked his head and quietly posed a rejoinder. Odette held her breath unconsciously as she was startled by the unexpected response. Bastian's smile had already given way to an unidentified tranquility at this precise time.

Was there a time when he was a mere boy, untainted by the weight of experience?

It was difficult for her to imagine such a thing, though she knew it must have been true once.

“It's enough for today, I suppose, so…”With a graceful lowering of her gaze, Odette called an end to the day's adventures. Though a warmth still lingered on her cheeks, she willed it away, but to no avail.

“I will respect the my lady’s wishes.” Bastian, ever the gentleman, respectfully acknowledged her request.

With a small sigh of relief, Odette raised her head once more. Ahead of her, Bastian's broad back was illuminated by the snowflakes outside the window, casting a gentle shadow on the glass.

Odette came to the conclusion that Bastian Klauswitz's dorm room had to be spotless.

Somehow, he seemed to be the kind of man that would be ideal for her.



As they exited the museum, Bastian and Odette made their way to retrieve their coats, leaving the Art History Museum through its rear gate. But as Odette descended the snow-covered steps, she suddenly made a gentle request.

"Let's say goodbye here," she whispered softly.

"Allow me to accompany you home," Bastian replied, steadfast in his duties.

"It's alright, Captain. My sister should be finishing school soon and the school is close by, I'll go home with her," Odette explained.

"Then, let me drive you both," Bastian offered.

"No, Tira might feel awkward," Odette declined.

"The snow shows no signs of stopping, it would be too much to walk in this weather," Bastian pointed out.

"I'll take the train. Thank you for a lovely time, Captain," Odette said with a smile.

And with that, the two parted their ways.

With a gentle smile adorning her face, Odette firmly stood by her decision. Her demeanor was as chill and delicate as the snowflakes that gracefully brushed against her cheeks.

Bastian cast a glance at his watch and reluctantly nodded in agreement.

The hour of their next rendezvous was fast approaching, and with the weather worsening by the minute, it was time to depart. Though a slight delay would not cause much inconvenience in this place, there was no need to impose upon the wishes of a woman who wished not to be troubled.

"Then I'll see you at the polo game," Bastian said.

As Odette bid farewell with a formal smile, she stepped away, her figure slowly disappearing into the white blanket of snow.

Bastian watched her leave, then turned on his heel, feeling the chill of the snowflakes melt away on his coat. But just as the memories of Odette began to fade, he remembered something.

He had promised to bring flowers to his aunt and quickly made his way to the shopping district to make good on his word. As he drove, his thoughts strayed back to Odette and he wondered where she could be.

It was only when he caught sight of a familiar figure across the street that he remembered. There she was, standing at the train station, accompanied by a schoolgirl. And as the light changed and she walked away, he realized that her excuse about her sister was not a lie after all.

Even with the heavy-looking grocery bag in her arms, Odette kept her composure. She didn't resemble her younger sister at all, who was bouncing around and acting like a puppy in excitement.

Odette warned her, the girl became silent for a bit, but soon began talking again. Not just physically, but also mentally too. The sisters were strikingly different from one another.

The train arrived as Bastian was searching for his lighter with a cigarette in his lips awaiting to be lit. Odette was swiftly shoved back as the shivering masses rushed in furiously. Evidently, she wasn't fit enough to board the train.

Bastian suddenly noticed the woman across the street and the frailty of her attire. Her blouse and skirt were neat, but her overcoat was heavily worn, just like the struggles of life. It was in the midst of spring when the proposal was made, and the onset of winter caught her unawares, leaving her without proper clothing to withstand the chill.

As the horn of a passing train blared, Bastian sighed and pivoted his car. The train at the station had departed and, as he expected, there were still passengers who had missed their chance to board. However, Odette was nowhere to be seen.

With a cigarette between his lips, Bastian hit the gas, ignoring the stop sign. Despite being pushed back by the throngs of people, Odette's determination allowed her to push her way onto the crowded train, and the vehicle carrying the woman gradually turned into a red dot, fading away into the distance.

With a graceful exhale of smoke, the woman was lost once more in the delicate swirl of white vapor.



As Odette fumbled for her key, the door suddenly creaked open. She and Tira exchanged surprised glances as they beheld their father standing before them, his presence uncharacteristically sober and absent of the usual alcohol scent.

"What are you waiting for? Come in, come in," Duke Dyssen beckoned, opening the door wider and stepping back.

With disbelief, Odette entered the house first, followed closely by Tira. As she carried the groceries to the kitchen, Duke settled at the end of the table, his behavior a stark contrast to his usual conduct.

"I’ll prepare dinner," After slipping into more comfortable clothing, Odette returned to the kitchen, donning her apron. Her father was still seated at the table, his behavior unexpectedly calm and collected.

As Odette deftly chopped the potatoes for the stew, her father, who had been silently observing for a while, suddenly spoke. "Your age... twenty?" he asked, a meaningful expression on his face.

"Twenty-one," Odette replied coolly, opening a bag of flour.

Duke Dyssen seemed to be taken aback, “twenty one..."he repeated her age. 

His face a mix of confusion and joy. Odette couldn't quite decipher his expression, but she didn't pry. She knew that she would never fully understand him anyway.

The kitchen was warmly lit by a new oil lamp, casting a gentle glow on Odette and Tira as they worked together to prepare dinner. They moved with a synchronized ease, creating an illusion that this was a normal, everyday occurrence in their household.

As the snow fell gently outside on this peaceful April evening, the Dyssen family was, for the first time in a long while, at amity.


Chapter 16.

Brazenly and Carelessly.



Odette von Dyssen graced the gathering at a time that suited the humble guests, blending seamlessly into the crowd. However, her fame was a hindrance to this peaceful arrival, attracting attention from all corners.

Ella von Klein, impatiently awaiting Odette's arrival, rushed to her side and greeted her warmly, "Hello, do you remember me? We met at the ball that night."

With a warm smile, Odette replied, "Ah yes. You're the daughter of Count Klein and the fiancée of Mr. Franz Klauswitz, am I right?"

"Exactly! I was so impressed that you remembered me so clearly despite your busy schedule. Thank you for being so kind," Ella gushed, leading Odette to join her group.

Fortunately, Ella was able to more readily gain the focal point of every conversation today because the fussy old lady wasn't with her.

As the rumors claimed, Odette von Dyssen was unique and distinctive.

The woman stood alone, much like the circumstances that had led her to the edge of the cliff, but she carried no hint of arrogance. Her presence was soft and inviting, often acting as a listener but engaging in conversation when required with grace and charm. A true epitome of elegance and poise.

"I was worried that winter had returned, I am glad to see the weather improving once more.” Ella said. 

As the discussion came to a close, the young daughter of Count Brandt offered her first remarks, her eyes shining with admiration. "Your dress is stunning, it truly brings out your beauty."

Claudine von Brandt, rising from her seat, approached Odette with delicate steps, while Ella watched the interaction with curious eyes, studying the air between the two ladies.

Claudine gazed at Odette's attire, a gentle smile curling on her lips. "It reminds me of Reine's creations, so elegant and sophisticated. That dress shop truly knows how to handle delicate fabrics like chiffon and silk with such grace."

Ella and the other ladies looked taken aback, not recognizing the shop named. Curiosity and suspicion gleamed in their eyes as they gazed at Claudine.

Could it be a test? They wondered.

Ella's eyes flickered with excitement, her gaze fixed upon Claudine's face as she tried to discern her motives.

It seemed impossible for someone like Odette, who came from humble origins, to have a custom-made gown from such an upscale boutique.

The dress Odette donned today appeared to be the handiwork of a talented seamstress, but upon closer scrutiny, one could discern the telltale signs of additions. It was clear that the gown was not made specifically for her.

"No surprise there," a young woman drawn near to Ella whispered. "I'm often overlooked when I visit the shop."

"His Majesty can be rather ungenerous," the young woman continued. "Using Odette as a mere pawn to safeguard the Princess, it would have been considerate if he had gifted her with some practical attire."

"The gathering party was so sudden that there was no time to waste," Ella spoke, shielding Odette in reverence for the Klauswitz family. She was aware of the stringent procedures at the sought-after dress shops. "Bookings must be made two seasons’ in advance at the most popular establishments."

However, even the most demanding shops would not dare defy the royal decrees. The royal family chose not to intervene, viewing Odette's situation as beneath their notice. Despite their ability to offer aid with ease, they deemed it not worth their effort.

"Thank you for the kind words, Lady Brandt," Odette finally spoke up, drawing the attention of the ladies who were hushedly giggling. The poor woman found herself on the spot once again, facing their judgement.

If she were to react impulsively, she would be deeply mortified. However, acknowledging her ignorance and poverty was equally unbecoming. No matter her response, it seemed she could not escape the ridicule.

"You see, my knowledge and taste in fashion is still quite inexperienced," Odette explained with grace. "I am grateful for the guidance of my chaperone. The countess's niece and I share a similar figure, and I am lucky enough to be able to preview attire from various boutiques. Lady Brandt's recommendation will definitely be at the top of my list."

The other ladies looked at each other, unsure of what to make of Odette's response. But before they could react, the officers of the army entered the room, ready to commence the game.

“It was lovely talking with you, Lady Brandt, but I must be going now,” Odette said, trying to gracefully escape the awkward situation. Claudine, who had found her cousin, smiled warmly and bid her farewell. 

“Then let’s meet again soon, Lady Odette.”

Apparently, the previous conversation was already forgotten. The charming Claudine von Brandt bid farewell to Odette with a warm smile and a kind greeting.

"Ah, my apologies," Claudine added with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, "I've made a mistake earlier. The dress you're wearing, it's from Sabine's dress shop."

Odette gracefully accepted the correction with a smile, pretending to be grateful for the new information. Claudine turned to join the Army officers, her elegant silhouette blending into the crowd.

Just as Odette was taking a sip of refreshing lemonade, a joyful voice filled the air. It was Ella von Klein, excitedly greeting her fiancé, Franz Klauswitz.

"Franz, darling, you're finally here! I have been worrying about you." Ella gushed, clinging to her fiancé's arm.

Franz, with his dark brown curls and piercing gray eyes, greeted everyone with a warm smile, his gentle demeanor at odds with his reputation as the heir to a wealthy business family. He was the very picture of a refined artist, rather than a ruthless businessman, leaving those around him in awe.

Franz's demeanor dramatically worsened when it was finally his turn to welcome Odette.

"It's a delight to see you again, Lady Odette."

Franz's greeting was a bit hesitant, as he kept his gaze fixed on his shoes. His eyes, like a chilly mist, made Odette feel uncomfortable, yet she gracefully disguised it.

"Hello, Mr. Klauswitz. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance," she replied with a warm smile.

Just then, the players from the Admiralty treaded into the stadium, providing a perfect diversion for Odette. She turned her gaze to the other side of the sun-drenched lawn, observing the tall, strong, and fit young officers. They commanded the horses with a fierce grace, none more so than Bastian.

With quick strides, they approached the reception area, taking the time to inspect their horses before proceeding.

Odette took a deep, silent breath, raising her chin and expanding her chest, yet she still struggled to breathe in the confines of her constricting corset. Despite the discomfort, she had donned the ill-fitting garment, a necessary sacrifice in the name of fashion.

As Bastian strode confidently towards her, their eyes locked, and he beamed with a smile as bright as the sun at its highest point in the sky.



"Bastian Klauswitz, like a god of battle, captivated everyone with his striking beauty," Sandrine mused as she watched him engage in lighthearted conversation with his potential bride-to-be, chosen by the emperor. A mix of love and hatred swirled within her.

"It seems like they'll be tying the knot soon," chimed in a young woman with an innocent expression, seeking a reaction from Sandrine. With a bright smile, Sandrine nodded in agreement.

"I hope so. Bastian's life will be much more settled with a strong partner by his side as he sets off on his next assignment," she said, her words ringing with a sense of genuine concern for her friend.

"It's sweet of you to think that way, Sandrine. Your kind heart shines through," the young woman said, a bit flustered by Sandrine's boldness.

"It's only natural for friends who share a deep bond," Sandrine replied with a warm smile, her words successfully masking the deceit beneath.

She hurriedly changed the subject, maybe realising that there was no point in extending this discussion. It was the type of boring conversation that society's young ladies like, bragging about their husbands and their children.

Sandrine gracefully excused herself from the conversation and returned her attention to the joyous couple. Despite her inner turmoil, her smile remained serene and composed, as if a gentle breeze had swept away any hint of animosity. She took a deep breath and allowed herself to bask in the beauty of the moment, letting go of any undesirable feelings and thoughts.

Sandrine watched the couple and couldn't help but feel the same passion the princess felt for Bastian. She was also all too aware of the madness that would accompany her desire to be with such a man. Despite this, she lacked the audacity to behave as the princess had. While she was still single, it was a precarious balancing act of good fortune and sad destiny.

She let out a heavy sigh as she momentarily saw her husband's face.

In the end, she had got the worst husband in the entire world—Count Lenart, a sodomite—but she couldn't despise him. She was able to take advantage of his flaws and force a divorce without consequence because of him, and that weakness allowed her to obtain Bastian Klauswitz.

With that in mind, Sandrine might pardon him for his folly. It would be unfair to cling to his small-minded side, who was dithering the divorce proceedings to the point where he could cut her alimony by even a single cent.

How much time had passed since she had last gazed upon him with such longing?

As Bastian turned his head, Sandrine's feelings of anger and frustration were instantly replaced with love. Despite her wounded pride, she couldn't help but fall under his spell once more.

With a flirtatious wink, Sandrine gestured towards the lounge. There was no doubt that Bastian wouldn't pick up on her meaning.

"Oh, I think I need to take a brief respite," she said, feigning a stumble and spilling her sherry as an excuse. Rushing away from the reception, she bid farewell to the women whose false concern was etched upon their faces. As she stood at the end of the grand hallway, her heart pounded with excitement and anticipation.

Sandrine could feel her heart race with anticipation As the strong footsteps approached,  . She knew it was Bastian, even though his face was obscured by the backlight. She took a deep breath, her voice as soft and gentle as the spring breeze.

"Don't you have something to tell me?" she asked, as Bastian finally turned the corner.

"I have something to ask you," Bastian replied, a hint of a smile playing on his lips.

Sandrine stood up from her leaning position against the wall, taking a step forward towards Bastian. The handsome man stood before her, wearing a nonchalant confidence on his charming face.


Chapter 17.

Fake Lovers.





Odette was surprised with an amazing sight as she entered the gorgeous archway leading to the stadium. A lush garden was tucked between the horseshoe-shaped structures, creating a peaceful haven. It was enjoyable to navigate the area because the entry and exit were connected by a beautiful route.

However, Odette's haste to complete her tasks was briefly interrupted as she took in the intricate structure of the polo club, more complex than she had initially anticipated. Nevertheless, she remained determined to complete her errands before Bastian's return, eager to cross everything off her to-do list.

Odette encountered a conundrum as soon as she entered the building's vast foyer.

The directions provided to her were clear - go straight ahead and then take the second door on the right. However, there was no visible path that led directly to her destination. Instead, she was presented with a branching pathway that split off in two directions, leaving her with her own choice to make.

Odette gazed into the depths of her recollection, searching for answers to her confusion. Out of the blue, the elegant and poised Ella von Klein appeared like her savior, offering her guidance on the location of the coveted powder room. Odette hung onto her every word, taking meticulous notes to ensure she wouldn't miss a single detail.

And as she pondered over all the information gathered, a brilliant realization dawned upon her - this was simply a quaint initiation ceremony, unlike anything she had ever experienced before. The young ladies erupted into peals of laughter at Ella's casual explanation, and Odette couldn't help but smile at the charm of it all. It seemed that this was indeed the answer to her puzzlement.

Odette made her way towards the right side of the building Embracing the moment,. Despite the slight dizziness that persisted, she pushed forward with steady steps, taking in her surroundings like osmosis as she went.

The weather, however, proved to be an unexpected challenge. The remnants of last weekend's snow still clung stubbornly to various parts of the city, making her footing uncertain. Yet, the sun shone brightly, its rays beaming down as if beckoning the arrival of summer.

In hindsight, Odette wished she had heeded the wise counsel of the maid, who had advised her to leave a little extra time. But no matter, it was a small hiccup in an otherwise adventurous journey.

Odette traced the shape of the corset that was keeping her from breathing, and she let out a long sigh out of suffocation.

Odette was the one who insisted the strings be pulled tighter than required. It was because Bastian's obvious body-scanning gaze made her think of the awkward evening ball. Once more, she had made the choice to put up with the inconvenience rather than go through it again. She had no idea that she would wind up in such a situation.

"You two complement one other so well. Not at all, I believe, would I be surprised to learn of your wedding plans."

Odette could hear a woman laughing in a lovely melody as she came to the end of the hallway. When she heard her own name mentioned in the conversation, it was as if a kind hand had been extended to grab her as she was about to turn around.

"If Lady Odette is to be your chosen bride, I do hope you will have the courtesy to inform me beforehand. After all, our friendship is worth that much, don't you think?" The words echoed with a warm familiarity, and Odette paused and take in the moment.

As she weighed her options, the sound of a young man's laughter echoed in the background, she instantly recognized it. The sound belonged to Bastian.

"Countess, I must say I'm not particularly fond of that type of speech," Bastian spoke with a tinge of amusement in his voice, yet his words held a certain chill.

"From a purely professional standpoint, Lady Odette and I are merely engaging in a mutually beneficial arrangement. Does that answer your question to your satisfaction?" Bastian's tone was firm, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

"Swear to me, my dear," the woman's voice filled with a mix of excitement and comfort, eagerly awaiting a response.

"As much as I would like to, I cannot swear an oath to a deity, it holds no meaning to me," the reply came, laced with a hint of nonchalance.

"What if you were to swear upon your own glory and success?" The woman pressed, a mischievous glint in her eye.

"Well, Sandrine, that would be quite the tall order," 

"Forgive me, I know I'm being overly anxious, but it's difficult to keep these insecurities at bay," she chuckled, a touch of vulnerability in her voice.

"I completely understand, Countess," came the compassionate response, one filled with understanding and empathy.

"It seems the divorce proceedings will take much longer than I had initially anticipated. I would have given up everything just for my freedom, but it seems my father's will prevails," Sandrine sighed, a hint of frustration evident in her tone. "I recently received a missive from my father, illuminating him of the injustices inflicted upon you in the name of safeguarding the princess. He sees this as a fortuitous opportunity - a much more favorable image for the world to see, you married to a woman rather than settling for a divorcee in haste."

"My sentiments align with Lord Laviere's." 

"I fear your father and yours both share ice water in their veins," Sandrine spoke with a hint of disapproval, keeping her tone gentle.

Odette's gaze wavered with stoic resolve as she intoned the name "Laviere." 

It belonged to the striking red-haired noblewoman, Sandrine de Laviere, who had been wed into the prestigious Velian family but was now in the midst of a divorce from Count Lenart. Society whispered of the proceedings, yet Sandrine's married name still echoed with familiarity. 

"Won't you grant me a tiny boon for my solace?" With an intimate lilt, Sandrine implored Bastian.

 “Tell me, Sandrine.” Bastian chuckled in response, causing Odette to shyly withdraw, unwilling to listen in further.

"Allow me to be graced with a slice of your moonlight, just as you grace her with the warmth of your sun."

With the bold, beguiling words, the hushed and heated exchange between Odette and her mysterious admirer came to a close.

Taking a moment to steady herself, Odette made her way back to the grand foyer, her breaths even and her heart calm. She sought refuge in the powder room, took a moment to compose herself, and then stepped out once more, ready to carry on with the facade of a professional relationship.

It would be simple, she told herself. Just a matter of willpower and poise.



“Our friendship is too valuable to be ruined over a passing fancy.”

Sandrine could feel her despair as Bastian's response confirmed what she already knew. But she chastised herself for the absurd sense of disappointment. Bastian was an uncontrollable, free-spirited individual. Then again, this feeling appeared to be shared by all other ladies.

A dashing gentleman, who could be counted on to never run dry of romantic endeavors, yet, he remained devoted to his self-imposed loyalty to the lovely ladies of high society. He was a scourge and an irresistible lure all at once.

"Ah yes, friendship, a bond as precious as gold." Sandrine let out a melancholic sigh. Approached her with ease Bastian, he had been observing her in silence.

With graceful ease, he adjusted the embellishment on his hat, as Sandrine stood frozen, her cheeks blushing like a schoolgirl holding her breath. Though the distance between them was but a mere hand's reach, it seemed as though only Sandrine was aware of its significance.

"Hold your head high, Countess," Bastian spoke, teasing his lips with a smile.

With a final, delicate touch, Bastian adjusted her corsage to perfection before taking a step back, a small smirk playing at the corners of his lips.

"It's quite lovely," he murmured, his words dripping with a hint of sarcasm. Sandrine simply let out a helpless giggle, her cheeks flush with embarrassment. Despite her reservations, she was unable to deny the twinkle in Bastian's eye, she felt drawn to his calculating charm like gravity. Though he had no intention of holding onto her, he was equally unwilling to let her go.

Though she was aware that this man was skillfully exploiting her, but she didn't care. Because of his unbridled ambition, Bastian Klauswitz was a man who loved nothing else besides himself.

Bastian vanished around the corner like thin air. Sandrine’s heart grew full of the happiness the realization had brought her.

However Sandrine was struggling for a long time to withdraw her hand, for it was aching from the hat she was holding.



Odette made a surprise appearance as the festivities were about to come to an end, looking confused and as though she had no idea when they would conclude.

Bastian stood up with a composed smile after patiently waiting for the enigmatic woman who disappeared without a trace. All eyes were on them now that the other attendants had finished their pre-ceremony rites. They were the last two left. Odette seemed to be a seductive woman who grabbed attention with ease everywhere she went.

"Oh my, it seems I got a little turned around in this labyrinth of a building," Odette chuckled, offering a sheepish apology. But Bastian just waved it off with a nonchalant smile.

"No need to worry, the pre-ceremony is still ongoing," he informed her, pointing to the nearby couple where the wife had gifted her husband a token of good luck.

"A lovely tradition, don't you think? Where a lady shows her support to her partner. And if you'd like to do the same for me, I promise to repay you with a victorious performance," Bastian said with a glint in his eye.

Odette gave a small nod, taking in the scene before her and understanding the significance of the pre-ceremony. Though she remained silent, Bastian could see the gears turning in her mind as she considered her next move.

“Allow me, my dear,” Bastian purred in her ear, his breath warm and inviting. In one fluid motion, he untied the hairpiece that was holding back her stunning locks, freeing the dark tresses to cascade down her back.

The onlookers let out a collective gasp, but Bastian paid them no mind. He simply looked at Odette, a knowing smile playing on his lips.

Everything she wore to make herself look like a proper lady was borrowed. Nothing she owned was truly hers, so she didn't feel like giving them away. The hush between them was broken by the snickering of passersby who had figured out what was going on.

“Captain, I….”

“Your true beauty shines brighter without it,” he whispered, his eyes drinking in the sight of her. 

Odette’s cheeks reddened in surprise and embarrassment, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she basked in the warmth of Bastian’s attention, knowing that this small act had just solidified their partnership in the most unexpected way.

With the pink ribbon, shimmering and smooth, resting in his hand, Bastian approached Odette once more. The spring breeze teased at her long, flowing hair, creating a more alluring look than when it was styled to perfection.

“This is a treasure I'll hold dear,” Bastian declared, with a respectful bow.

And with that, he spun on his heel, ready to take on the field of play with newfound fervor. For Bastian, playing ball on horseback was more than just a sport, it was a chance to embody the knightly spirit of chivalry.

With a sly grin, Bastian secured the pink ribbon with a subtle sheen, reminiscent of the cool and smooth nape of his lady's neck, to his polo stick. The elegant embroidery of Odette's initials, adorned with delicate floral patterns, added a touch of chivalry to his usual rough exterior. Despite thinking the whole charade was a foolish display, he was ready to put on a show for the curious onlookers.

After all, if playing along meant gaining an advantage, why not embrace the role of the perfect gentleman?


Chapter 18.

The Hunting Ground.







Odette gazed at the man with a furrowed brow, seated in the stands, as she beheld the captain's number - 3 - worn by Bastian Klauswitz. It didn't take long for her to grasp the reason for this commoner's distinguished position on a team composed of the offspring of prominent families.

As the game unfolded, the player who had deftly secured the ball started sprinting towards the opposing team's goal post, with Captain Klauswitz - number 3 - leading the charge. Today, he emerged as the shining star of the polo field, earning the title of hero for the Admiralty team.

As the Navy team took control of the game, the excitement in the stands reached a fever pitch. The passionate roars of the fans echoed through the clear sky, drowning out all other sounds. Spectators put aside their worries for a moment and focused solely on the action on the field. And the ladies? Well, they brought out their opera glasses, eager not to miss a single thrilling moment of the match.

Odette sat with poised elegance, watching the game unfold. It had been a decade since her last polo match, but her memories of the sport were still fresh. And with the game's fluid rhythm, it was easy for her to slip right back into being a fan once again.

The spectators let out a chorus of sighs as one player was thwarted from scoring. Despite the setback, the game continued with unrelenting intensity, far from its original purpose of fostering camaraderie between the two teams. Amid the fast-paced action on the expansive field, Odette's eyes zeroed in on Bastian, who stood out thanks to the pink ribbon adorning his stick. Despite being an unknown player, he was easy for Odette to spot.

As the man spoke with a calculated tone, Odette couldn't help but feel a shiver run down her spine. He was cold and ruthless, but it was all part of the game.

She remembered Bastian's unapologetic greed, which he had never tried to hide. This was the reason why she agreed to his marriage proposal, even though she was aware of it. Though the news of his secret affair with Countess Lenart was unsettling, it was simply a personal matter that had no bearing on their business relationship.

But then, something caught her attention, a pink ribbon tied to Bastian's polo stick. With that simple gesture, all the confusion in her mind vanished, as she focused her attention on the game.

"Go! Move it! Push harder!"

Suddenly, a thunderous roar erupted from the spectators, who were on their feet, cheering. They were chanting Bastian's name, as he charged forward with unrelenting determination.

The audience leaped from their seats and began chanting in unison one player's name. Bastian. That man was the one who was fiercely attacking once more.

Bastian swung the stick hard, sending the ball sailing across the goal as Odette considered how to react.

The Navy's first goal.





Bastian, sensing his horse's slowing pace, directed it towards the stables, where fresh mounts were kept. With effortless grace, he made the switch, hopping from one horse to another, and galloped onto the field atop a white stallion known to be the fastest of all the polo horses.

The sound of clashing polo sticks filled the air as Bastian skillfully wrested the ball from his opponent and aimed for the enemy goalpost. The game was at its climax, the offense and defense constantly shifting, with the final score tied in a nail-biting showdown.

Bastian galloped away at full speed after once more launching the ball a long distance. The Army captain, who had been denied possession of the ball he had grabbed in front of the goalpost, ran after him in a rage. It didn't take long for a corner battle involving eight horses to break out when the players from both teams to arrive to assist and to join in.

Bastian, galloping forward with a small gap, leaned his upper body and put all of his weight on the left hand that was gripping the reins. Even though he was still far from the goal, the tenacious defense made it hard to safely advance the ball in front of them.

Bastian decided to take a chance at that point and swung his stick ferociously. The ball sailed into the bright white light as he sat erect, his upper body bowed down so far that it was parallel to the lawn.

With unbridled speed, Bastian's horse thundered across the field, carrying its rider to victory. And as he rode, the sound of Erich's voice could be heard echoing through the arena, filled with wild excitement.

"I love you, you crazy spirit!" Erich cried, his voice filled with a frenzied joy.

And then, in the blink of an eye, it was all over. The red flag was waving, signaling the score. The whistle was blowing, signaling the end of the match. And as Bastian circled the field, taking in the cheers of the crowd, he saw her. Odette. Sitting in the stands, watching him. As the enthusiastic crowd erupted around her, she remained poised and collected. Her face was expressionless, yet she cheered on his victory. With a silent bow, she congratulated him with grace and poise.

Bastian couldn't help but admire Odette's perfect demeanor, as she effortlessly carried out her duties without ever giving more than what was required. Though her demeanor was reserved, her devotion to her responsibilities was unwavering.

After acknowledging her bow, Bastian gently turned his horse's head and rode off, satisfied knowing that Odette had fulfilled her duties to the fullest. For him, that was all that mattered.



Sandrine stumbled upon a chance discovery in the players' waiting room as she celebrated the victory. Engaging in conversation with her cousin Lucas, she was unable to locate Bastian who had retreated to take a champagne-soaked shower.

Eager to keep busy, Sandrine set her sights on Bastian's gear, finding the unmistakable sight of the infamous pink ribbon tied to his equipment.

It was unprecedented. A shocking and absurd sight to behold. The gaudy ribbon tied to the polo stick was a testament to Bastian's audacity, a man who had built a reputation as a formidable polo player since his days at the military academy.

Every year, he had taken center stage as a starting player in major competitions, yet he had never bothered with the pre-game ceremony. A blatant disregard for the timeless tradition that considered it a disgrace to not receive a token of a noble lady.

The inaugural moment should have been exceptional. Sandrine had always envisioned that when the day finally arrived, she would be the shining star. It was an unspoken understanding between them. But now, as she stood before Bastian's equipment, her heart ached with doubt. Had Bastian Klauswitz become just another insignificant man? She tenderly untangled the ribbon, unraveling it with ease as she struggled with her conflicting emotions.

Sandrine's eyes, which had been roving over the busy officers, lingered once more on the ribbon in her grasp. Its acquisition had been a momentary impulse.

"Are you departing so soon? Would you not linger a while longer?" Lucas enquired, as he searched for a new cigarette to light. Sandrine gave a bright smile, masking the ribbon with fluid grace.

"My apologies, but I don't believe now is the appropriate moment for a meaningful conversation. Let us make plans for the next opportunity."

"I understand. I will inform him of your visit," replied Lucas with a nod.

"Thank you, Lucas. And what of Lady Odette? Will she be joining us for the players' celebration?"

"It is a possibility. However, you are Bastian's companion. Have no fear," Lucas reassured with a soft smile and a dismissive wave of his hand.

"I understand your concerns, but trust me, Sandrine. He's merely trying to impress His Majesty. We all know Bastian is in a difficult situation due to the impulsive princess.

"Yes, I am aware," replied Sandrine.

"Just have faith and wait. She will be cast aside once he extricates himself from the predicament. She may have made a poor first impression, but I assure you she is a respectable woman."

Lucas spoke with animation, but abruptly cut his words short.

"Why was the first meeting so disordered?" Sandrine asked, intrigued.

"Let's just say, Bastian and that woman will never be a match," Lucas replied, mysteriously elusive.

Despite her attempts to delve deeper, it seemed like she would have to wait for a more opportune moment to get a clearer answer. Resigning herself to the situation, Sandrine gracefully concluded the conversation with a smile. As she made her way out of the steamy waiting room, surrounded by the musky scent of men and the warm air, her heart felt heavy and cold.

It was undeniable, Lady Odette was a stunning woman.

In the kingdom, personal emotions were not taken into consideration. It was a mystery why a gorgeous woman such as Lady Odette would devote her entire life to being a servant, attending to her unsightly father.

She could have easily become a second spouse or the concubine of a wealthy man, had she so desired.

Sandrine's heart was filled with apprehension. She feared that the beautiful Lady Odette had a hidden weapon that she was not aware of. What if her seemingly simple life was merely a guise for a greater ambition?

Bastian Klauswitz was a ray of sunshine that illuminated Sandrine's life. With his popularity as a polo player and the support of the Emperor, he was a valuable catch. However, Bastian was a wise and discerning man, and Sandrine could not help but worry that she may not be able to win his heart.

He was, after all, a man in his prime, heroic or ambitious. Odette was also a lady with nothing left to lose. She would be that man's wife if she were to foolishly fling herself into the world and have even one child.

She was driven to give Odette a modest gift as soon as she stepped foot in the clubhouse garden.

Sandrine quickly picked a good location after carefully scanning the area. It was a pool formed by the melting of the leftover snow that was beside the trail and was shaded by a tree.

With unwavering resolve, Sandrine made her way forward, her fingers clasping a ribbon of the finest silk. The delicate stitching of Odette's initials was a testament to her exceptional craftsmanship. As the wind picked up, carrying the scent of blooming flowers, Sandrine loosened her hold on the ribbon. It danced in the breeze before finally coming to rest upon a tranquil pool of water.

The bravest of hunters might capture the most majestic of game in this region, which offered great opportunity. With the benefit of time and wisdom gained through experience, Sandrine could now completely appreciate the profundity of the advice her mother had previously given her on the day of her debut.

Before departing from the verdant garden, Sandrine cast a final glance towards the token she had left behind. The soft pink ribbon, now ensconced in the mire, was a vivid contrast to its surroundings, catching the eye with its hue.

She had nothing against the poor woman, but the situation was a little different when it came to competing for the same prey.

It was in that moment that the hue, which had previously irked her, now appeared to be a shade of captivating beauty.


Chapter 19.

She's Mine.



Odette, the last person to go, gently got up from her seat in the audience. It was now appropriate for her to accompany Bastian to the lavish party that would be held in the Admiralty's sumptuous rooms. She might have easily travelled there by herself, but she thought it would be foolish to do so.

Odette took a deep breath and prepared herself as she stood beneath the imposing archway linking the stadium and the clubhouse. She felt proud of her vow to keep the highest standards of excellence and her duty to fully carry out her responsibilities as Captain Klauswitz's companion.

"Lady Odette," called a warm, familiar voice as she stepped into the serene gardens of the clubhouse. It was the wife of a naval officer who had kept her entertained with lively conversation throughout the match. "Good luck," she offered with a gentle smile, before taking her leave with her husband.

As Odette made her way to the heart of the bustling promenade, she soon discovered the reason for the words of encouragement from the naval officer's wife. There, in a puddle beneath a tree, lay a discarded pink ribbon. The gaze of the onlookers surrounding it was trained upon Odette, their expressions a curious mix of pity and interest, much like that of the officer's wife she had just met.

Odette stood between the throng, her eyes fixed upon the mud-stained ribbon. Its initials, so carefully embroidered, now smudged with dirt. It was her cherished ribbon, taken without her permission by the man before her.

"Are you alright?" inquired a lady, her voice soft with concern.

With a gentle smile, Odette took a step back, her eyes still upon the ribbon. Though it had once been her prized possession, she now had no desire to claim it back. For once it had left her possession, it was no longer hers to keep. Bastian had taken it, and with it, the authority over its fate. It was a bittersweet realization, but one she accepted with grace.

"Excuse me," Odette said, turning to the young woman from earlier. "May I ask for a small favor?" And with a kindly nod, the woman agreed.

"Speak freely, as much as you like," the young woman said with a bright smile.

"Unfortunately, I'm not feeling well and must depart early," Odette responded, her voice full of regret. "But Captain Klauswitz's preparations seem to be delayed. I would be most grateful if you could break the news to him in my stead."

"Ah, yes, of course! I'll make sure the Captain knows," the young woman said, her eyes full of understanding and compassion. "Don't worry, I've got you covered."

With a polite farewell, Odette strode confidently from the garden, the sting of a disapproving gaze upon her back. She refused to look back, knowing deep down that he didn't truly want the best for her. The moment she laid eyes upon the discarded ribbon, Odette realized that her usefulness to him had come to an end, and she walked away without a hint of regret.

As she walked away from the polo club and out into the city, the weight of abandonment pressed heavily upon her. She had foolishly thrown herself into the situation with enthusiastic abandon, only to find herself discarded like the mud-stained ribbon left behind. It would have been a kindness if he had been clear with her from the start.

A soft sigh escaped her lips as she walked down the streets of Ratz in May. The city was a paradise of roses, making it hard to believe that just a week ago, snow had blanketed the streets. The brilliant afternoon sun painted the world in gold as she walked down the street, lost in thought.

Suddenly, she came to a halt in front of a theater, her gaze drawn to the advertisement billboard towering above her. Discount sales at the department store, upcoming opera performances, and job ads--posters announcing all manner of news filled the cylinder, each vying for her attention.

With a thoughtful gaze, Odette fixated upon a small, black-and-white flyer at the bottom of the advertisement billboard. In elegant script, the advertisement sought a tutor, with specifications listed below the headline - a preference for young, unmarried women of educated middle-class backgrounds, with a proficiency in literature, foreign languages, music, and etiquette, and a well-groomed appearance. 

The notice promised a substantial income for the right candidate. Odette, with a hint of concern, carefully transcribed the advertisement into a dainty notebook she retrieved from her purse. The grand performance for the Emperor had come to a close and it was time to return to the realities of daily life.



With the bustling clubhouse now hushed, Bastian stepped out into the brilliant afternoon sun, surrounded by his uniformed colleagues. Lucas, ever observant, made idle conversation, bringing up the name of Sandrine.

"If only we'd known, we could have brought her along to the party," he said with a hint of regret. Bastian merely smiled, not feeling the need to respond.

The news of Lady Odette's sudden departure had already circulated among the guests, leaving Bastian with a sense of uncharacteristic emptiness. Though he couldn't quite put his finger on why, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The thought passed quickly though, as he reminded himself that they had only met five times.

"Could it be that the fabled ribbon of the beguiling princess lies cast aside in that puddle of mire?" Erich Faber's voice boomed as he led the way. Bastian's forehead creased as he couldn't help but cast a glance at the ribbon. There, at his feet, lay Odette's ribbon, sullied by the mud. 

"What happened? Did you cast it aside, my friend?" Erich asked, his tone full of disbelief. 

"Do you think perhaps she caught sight of it and fled, heartbroken?" another officer chimed in.

"Imagine if she's come to her senses and fled this charade!" one officer exclaimed. But Lucas von Ewald was not among those who shared the same sentiment. His gaze grew uneasy as he fixed it on the discarded ribbon, "Bastian, this could mean...”

Bastian averted his sight and didn't respond. Odette fled as if fleeing earlier while Sandrine spent some time in the waiting area. And the ribbon, which was discarded as a show for everyone to witness. When everything was put together, there seemed to be only one conclusion.

Bastian chuckled, his amusement mixed with a hint of determination. I'll do anything to keep what's mine.  A belief that he held close to his heart, one that was deserving of being held in high esteem, not cast aside in the guise of false nobility.

"Just to be clear, Sandrine would never do that, Bastian!" Lucas, clearly taken aback, attempted to defend his cousin. The exclamation caused the other officers nearby to gasp in shock.

Undeterred, Bastian approached the muddy puddle and reached down to retrieve the ribbon, his actions leaving Lucas bewildered.

"Have you lost your mind?" Lucas asked, incredulous.

"What’s going on? The legendary Klauswitz meets a siren's allure?" spoke an officer with a hint of amusement. "Wake up, my friend, the dangers of a sea-witch's seduction are not to be taken lightly," warned another. But Bastian remained unperturbed, his calm demeanor only slightly interrupted by the gentle lowering of his eyebrows. With grace, he retrieved the soiled ribbon, a symbol of ownership. 

She’s mine. He declared with unwavering conviction.

Whatever the case may be. No matter how he felt about it. In either case, as of just now, it was his to safeguard as it fell under his purview.

Bastian moved swiftly across the garden. His fingertips left smudges of murky water along the path.

The clubhouse's garden was peaceful once again as the loud officers left. The waves on the puddle's surface where the ribbon had vanished had quieted, as if nothing had happened at all.





It was if the stars had aligned, and fate had brought them together once more. A gentle breath escaped Franz as he observed the structure across the street, nestled in the embrace of the alley's shadows. The reunion was a chance encounter, beyond explanation.

Soon after, a light appeared in the window at the opposite end of the top floor. The residence appeared to be the woman's.

He passed Odette on the way back after dropping off his fiancée.

As luck would have it, Odette was there when he tilted his head along the breeze since he was feeling stuffy and had dropped the car window, allowing a lovely breeze to enter.

With a heavy heart, Franz watched as Odette walked the lonely streets of Preve Boulevard. He was filled with a confusing mix of emotions, a mixture of anger and sadness that he could not quite explain. He wondered why she was wandering alone instead of celebrating with Bastian. The urge to uncover the source of these emotions was too strong to ignore, and without a second thought, he stepped out of the car, determined to uncover the truth.

Franz walked with a pounding heart, trailing behind the woman he had come to recognize as Odette. Despite his tumultuous emotions, he remained calm, keeping his distance from her. He couldn't help but think about the marriage proposal arranged by the emperor for Bastian. His parents saw it as a fantastic opportunity for their son, a chance to find a wife who could be a dependable support. They didn't seem to consider the fate of the poor woman who would be thrown to the beast.

Franz's thoughts were interrupted as he saw the silhouette of the slender woman reflected in the glass window through which the light streamed in. He couldn't help but hold his breath, marveling at her beauty. But then, the reality of the situation struck him and he let out a sigh, unsure of what the future held for Odette.

Despite his eagerness, his hopes were dashed as Odette never parted the curtains of her window. Franz was left disappointed, longing for just a glimpse of her.

"He tossed the ribbon." Ella giddily spoke with gleeful eyes, as if the act was just a mere prelude to a much grander performance by Odette. And indeed, Ella's lighthearted nature was simply a reflection of who she was. However, the rest of the crowd that had gathered held nothing but disdain and animosity towards Odette, including Bastian who had been unwillingly betrothed to her by the emperor's arrangement.

As he stood in the shadowed alley, Franz couldn't help but imagine Odette as his own. If only Odette were mine. He gazed longingly at her window, envisioning a life filled with love and happiness. The twilight deepened into night, and the stars came out to twinkle in the sky. But just as the clear spring evening reached its peak, the curtains closed and Franz knew it was time to leave his reverie behind.

Franz realized that he was in deep trouble as he thought of his mother's impending fury. Having sent his fiancé back early and disappearing without a trace, abandoning his car and driver, he knew he wouldn't get away easily.

He strutted through the outskirts of town, trying to come up with a believable excuse. The sight of Odette's illusion dissipating was soul-crushing, as it was hard to fathom such a gorgeous woman living in such a desolate place. He knew Bastian Klauswitz would never marry her. 

Bastian Klauswitz would never marry Odette. He thought to himself. But as he crossed the Prater river bridge, he was overcome with the thrill of what once seemed impossible.

He envisioned Odette in a brilliant light, shining brightly in the darkness. This was a euphoric dream that he never wanted to wake up from.

Chapter 20.

Uninvited Guest.





The enormous palace's halls were shaken by a sound that echoed the groan of a tortured creature. Everyone, even the palace, was shocked to learn that the imperial princess was the source of the heartbreaking sob.

"Your Highness, stop crying. Yes?”

The gentle touch of the nanny's hand, softly wiping away the tears from the princess's face, brought a moment of calm. But it was only a momentary respite, as the sobs soon started again. A cousin who had come to the summer palace to comfort the grieving princess, spoke of the polo match being held in the capital, held by the officers. Though they quickly realized their mistake and changed the topic, the words were already out in the open, spreading like spilled water.

"Oh dear Nanny, I implore you to grant me this one request. Just this once, can you not turn a blind eye to me sending this letter?” With tear-stained eyes, Isabelle made her plea, her voice wavering with desperation.

“Your Highness, do not forget the warning of Her Majesty. If you insist on carrying out this act, I shall be unable to remain in your service.” The nanny gently reminded her, with a touch of sadness in her voice.

Isabelle's eyes gazed out the window, toward the endless sea, as fresh tears streamed down her face. "Why must you all be so cruel? I simply wish to hear Bastian's reply.” She whispered, her heart aching with the weight of longing and sorrow. She felt as though she was shattered, broken into a million pieces, with no hope of ever putting herself back together. For everything she held dear now belonged solely to him.

For Isabelle, this grand abode, though magnificent, was naught but a cage, binding her within its gilded borders and restricting her every freedom, including our very words as they travel beyond its walls. Such strict measures, however, were deemed necessary by her parents in the aftermath of the tumultuous events at the ball

"Your Highness, I fear Captain Klauswitz's response left no room for doubt," The nanny spoke with a soft yet unwavering tone

"But, Nanny, I swear I saw a flicker of shock in Bastian's eyes, matching my own," Isabelle protested, her head shaking with disbelief.

As the years went by, the recollection of that fateful day grew ever more vivid in Isabelle's mind. She could still feel Bastian's eyes upon her, the warmth of his touch, and every quiver that ran through her fingers as if it had just happened yesterday. They needed to find a moment of privacy to share their deepest emotions, free from any prying eyes. Isabelle was convinced that once they had that chance to speak, everything would change for the better.

The anticipation was too much for Isabelle, who finally broke down in tears and collapsed onto her bed. Just then, a knock echoed through the room, and a familiar maid entered, carrying a small silver tray with a vial.

Isabelle, with serene submission, took her nightly slumbering tonic as was her custom. For her, the numbing embrace of slumber was preferable to the unyielding sting of heartache.

Yet within her dreams, she was free to bask in the warmth of love untethered. 

As she drifted off, her mind conjured visions of the happiness that should have rightfully been hers. She fondly remembered the moment when Bastian, during a triumphant polo match, requested the token of victory. With a smile, she surrendered her ribbon to him, and he sealed the victory with a kiss, proudly declaring their love to the world and cementing a promise of forever.






The crisp slicing of metal through air filled the stillness of the drill field, as the Sergeant's voice echoed with authority. Bastian, with a keen eye, surveyed the line of cadets, before deftly returning his command sword to its scabbard, signaling the end of the formal drill. 

At the Captain's resounding command, the cadets came to attention and rendered a salute, paying homage to the Navy and uplifting their spirits. Bastian, with a display worthy of his appointed duties, descended from the podium, his exit observed with steadfast admiration by the cadets. In a moment frozen in time, the fluttering flag was a graceful anomaly, a symbol of the unwavering spirit of those in service.

"The mere contemplation of having to endure this until the festival's conclusion brings tears to my eyes." As Lucas walked away from the parade ground, a murmur of discontent escaped his lips. 

Every autumn, the city of Lausanne, with its grandest naval port in the south, held a grand festival in honor of Navy Day. This year, the festivities were further amplified with a maritime procession to commemorate the triumph at the Battle of Trosa. The preparation for the celebration had consumed the entire year, and the un commissioned cadets were no exception. Bastian and Lucas had the daunting task of honing their skills and readying them for the festival's opening ceremony.

Lucas removed his gloves and started fanning himself after making sure they were the only two. When formal training came every Wednesday, the Navy's dispatch instructors were still supposed to be in impeccable ceremonial uniforms, although it was uncomfortable to stand in the midday sun with such a stiff appearance.

Bastian, with not a hair out of place, returned to headquarters with a composure that mirrored his poised demeanor on the platform. Lucas's grumbling subsided only upon entering the grand lobby of the Admiralty. 

With haste, Bastian attended to pressing matters, compiling the training report and promptly returning to his duties. He sifted through a flurry of paperwork before accompanying Admiral Demel on a private interview with the Chief of Staff of the War Department. The two opposing forces, renowned for their hostility, locked in a fierce battle of wits over trivialities, and the General's second-in-command was at the forefront of this conflict.

Admiral Demel typically scheduled meetings with the Army on Wednesdays, as it was a perfect occasion to showcase the poise and professionalism of a proper Admiralty officer.

"Well done. Let's call it a day," he proclaimed after a productive negotiation, his tone more magnanimous than usual. "Take the time to ponder another overseas mission," he added.

Bastian's fervent request was met with yet another rejection. 

"Do the aftermaths of your injury still linger? And you have many responsibilities yet to fulfill here. Regardless of what others may say, the leading figure of this naval celebration shall remain Captain Klauswitz, the victor of the Battle of Trosa. And soon enough, Major Klauswitz," said Admiral Demel, a proud smile gracing his face as he looked at Bastian. It seemed that until the conclusion of the maritime review ceremony, Bastian would have to play the role of a trophy for the Admiralty. 

"It's not just about the promotion to Major. Embrace the accolade with gratitude and remember, it is the demeanor of a noble soldier that serves as an inspiration to others." He added.

"I shall bear that in mind." Bastian calmly accepted the outcome.

"Also, Captain Klauswitz, may I request the pleasure of you conveying my warm regards to Lady Odette?" Admiral Demel's lips curved into a playful smile as he spoke to Bastian, who was just about to depart.

With a nod of agreement, Bastian fulfilled his superior's request with grace.” I shall do so." 

It was a matter of fulfilling duty, as commanded. And so, it was also the opportune moment to reconnect with a cherished acquaintance. Emerging from the admiral's quarters, Bastian made his way to the gymnasium located at the rear of the headquarters building. He first changed into his workout attire, then embarked on a brisk run around the grounds, returning afterward to build his strength through various exercises.



The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the city as Bastian left the gym. The evening air was filled with the familiar sights and sounds of a late spring day in the city. As he drove through the bustling city center, with its towering department stores and fancy shopping districts, Bastian's thoughts turned to a woman he knew, Odette.

A smirk crossed his face as he thought about the Emperor's apparent tight-fistedness. If he was going to use Odette to protect his daughter, the least he could do was ensure she was dressed well. The absurdity of the situation was not lost on Bastian, who chuckled to himself as he drove through the city.

As Bastian navigated his vehicle down Preve Boulevard, he was consumed by thoughts of a woman who, although always impeccably packaged, was often seen in attire borrowed from others. It seemed unjust that she should bear the label of a beggar princess. He made a mental note to make efforts in elevating her appearance, to bring her out of such a lowly reputation.

As he approached the townhouse, a serene world awash in a rosy glow, he was greeted by an unexpected scene. A mature gentleman was engaged in a heated argument with the mansion's servants at the gate.

As Bastian's car approached, the man's face lit up with excitement, and he eagerly extricated himself from the grip of the servants who were restraining him.

"Greetings, Captain Klauswitz!" The man approached with a warm smile, hat in hand. But when Bastian remained silent, he appeared crestfallen. "Surely you remember me?" It was the gambler of the night, the father of Lady Odette, Duke Dyssen. "How dare you snub me?" Duke Dyssen's rage-filled voice shattered the peaceful serenity of the garden.

"It's a relief that I don't have to clarify," Bastian said with a joyful grin, causing Duke Dyssen's face to flush a deep red, unable to conceal his feelings even if his life depended on it. The outcome of his crushing defeat at the gambling table was inevitable.

"Please be concise, Your Grace," Bastian said, striking a match and lighting a cigarette with practiced ease. The smoke curled upwards, swirling gently in the soft breeze that rustled through the garden's delicate leaves. Duke Dyssen cast a wary eye around, weighed down by the gravity of his thoughts. Bastian's impatience was palpable, adding a measure of callousness to the already rude gesture of smoking in the Duke's presence.

"My daughter is not meant to be in the hands of someone like you," Duke Dyssen stated with unwavering resolve, concealing his nervous hands under the table. He aimed to convey his staunch objection before entering into any negotiations. "No matter how times have changed, how dare a mere pawnbroker's descendant set his sights on a princess's daughter!" He shouted,  slamming his fist down on the table in anger. However, the response he was hoping for from Bastian did not materialize.

Bastian’s gaze was unwavering. As he watched the man before him grow increasingly incensed, a plume of smoke danced lazily from the end of his cigarette. 

Bastian muttered curses like a lullaby, referring to Duke Dyssen as a canine. The audacity of such words left the Duke stunned, unable to accept the insults directed towards him. But Bastian sat tall, relishing in the Duke's fury and basking in his utter embarrassment. 

The corners of his mouth curled upwards into a gentle smile, as he watched the Duke's disbelief turn into a seething glare.

Chapter 21.

The Wealthy Man's Effort and Sincerity.





"You don't resemble the same person who sold his daughter to me. Since I last saw you, you must have undergone an abrupt change of heart.” Bastian said skeptically, tilting his head.

Duke Dyssen hastily retorted, "Th-that was only a mistake I made in a stressful circumstance," having second thoughts about his scathing remark. It wouldn't be prudent to embarrass the captain Klauswitz, by acting rashly. Since he was well known for being reticent.

"Had I not shown mercy, the events of that fateful night at the gaming table would have taken a far different turn," Bastian spoke with confident ease about the subject. Meanwhile, Duke Dyssen was filled with unease, discomfited by the direction of the conversation, which was far from what he had anticipated. Just then, the tea server appeared, interrupting their discussion.

Regaining his breath, Duke Dyssen took a moment to survey his surroundings. The tea server approached with the grace of a ghost, effortlessly pouring the steaming liquid into delicate cups. 

Their uniform, made of the finest material, spoke of their high rank among the serving staff. It was clear that they were part of a family of great power and prestige, far removed from the tarnished reputation of a mere antique merchant's household.

The garden was a wild tangle of neglect, yet if one looked closely, the signs of once meticulous care were still visible. Amid the overgrowth, ancient trees and rare blooms could still be found, a testament to the discerning taste of the former owner. It was whispered that the mansion was acquired by the antique dealer in a debt settlement from an aristocratic family who couldn't repay their loans.

These parasites were like a filthy rat, spreading their contagion and eroding the world's order. The noble names that had built and protected the empire, its long history and traditions, were being ruined by these scoundrels, much like Duke Dyssen himself.

As they passed by the stately mansion, surrounded by verdant trees and adorned with a grand old fountain, Duke Dyssen's eyes wandered back to Bastian sitting across from him. The imperial officer's uniform, adorned with medals of distinction earned in wartime, and the opulent townhouse located in the heart of the capital all spoke of his elevated status. Had Duke Dyssen not known of Bastian's true origins, he would have easily believed him to be a scion of a prominent family yet, like a rat playing at royalty among the ruins of a lost kingdom, Bastian's true nature was revealed.

"Why don't you use that sharp tongue of yours to tell the emperor how you won Odette in a back alley gambling den? If you lack the courage, I'll do it for you. Your newfound reputation will be buried in the mud by dawn." Duke Dyssen spat out his animosity with biting words. He would have preferred a more sophisticated approach, but when the grandson of an antique dealer flaunted his arrogance, Duke Dyssen was left with no choice.

"Suit yourself." Bastian said nonchalantly as he took a sip of tea, his voice echoing in the darkening purple evening. "Is my reputation worth risking over such a trivial matter? It's no big deal if it gets tarnished."

"Ha! So the reputation of a hero is so easily sullied? At the end of the day, you can disguise yourself all you want, but your roots will always show.” Despite his taunts, Duke Dyssen's hands were soaked in cold sweat. In effort to conceal this, he redoubled his efforts.

"So you presume to preach me about honor?" Bastian sneered, flicking the remnants of his cigarette. His piercing blue eyes held the chill of a serpent's gaze, sending shivers down one's spine. 

"You may have the emperor's backing, but I am Odette's father, and I alone have the say in her fate. No matter what the emperor desires, you will need my blessing to lay claim to her." Duke Dyssen's voice rose in righteous anger, fueled by a fierce determination to protect his daughter by all means and ends.

Duke Dyssen had learned that Bastian was captivated with Odette. The whispers he gathered from his sources all confirmed the same tale, a scandal that had spread like wildfire through high society. What he saw and heard echoed this, a tale both intriguing and shocking. He knew all too well the power of love's sway, for he too had once been lost in its foggy haze.

It was a vexing insult to say that Duke Dyssen had attempted to take advantage of Princess Helene. If not for that, he would have abandoned his wife when she lost her status as an imperial princess. The fact that they had their precious diamond of a daughter, Odette, prevented that naive love from being totally worthless, even though they may have been better off in hindsight.

"I have the right to wed Odette to another person if I so choose. Odette will be far more suited to a more sophisticated and exquisite family, even if they are a little less wealthy, than you. You are nothing but a vulgar brat, even if you are a hero who is acclaimed."  Said Duke Dyssen.

Bastian tilted his head and grinned sarcastically, when he heard Duke Dissen's bluff.

"Then, why wait until now to wed your deserving daughter?" Bastian queried.

"I was merely being cautious. Had our family's circumstances not taken a turn, Odette would have been wed to the Empire's most renowned family, perhaps even a foreign royalty, destined to become a queen.”

"Oh, I see," Bastian nodded.

"So, to be worthy of my daughter's company, wouldn't it require a display of effort and genuine commitment?" the Duke proposed.

"Effort and genuine commitment," Bastian repeated with a smirk. "You really mean money, don't you?" And with that, Bastian exposed the Duke's true intentions.

"So, I'm getting to the point,"

"I won't be giving you anything.” Bastian interjected with a confident and dismissive tone. “If you wish to marry your daughter off to someone else, as you mentioned, it's your right as a father. I'll honor your decision. However, currently, the Emperor has his sights set on Lady Odette, so we'll have to wait and see what happens." 

He gave a casual shrug, his response taking the Duke by surprise.

"Whether you want to see her become the hostess of a prestigious family or a foreign queen, it's up to you, but if you want to keep that dream alive, you better consider all your options carefully."

"What?!" 

"Wouldn't it be a shame for your daughter's reputation to be tarnished by rumors of her association with a lowlife like me?" Bastian scoffed, the smirk on his face growing wider with each passing moment. "But for me, it's just another tale in the making." He leaned in, his words dripping with venom.  Duke Dyssen's eyes widened in disbelief as Bastian continued his relentless attack.

 "If you play your cards right, I'll return your daughter to you unscathed. Just like that fateful night at the gambling house." Bastian took a long drag from his cigarette, his blue eyes piercing into the Duke's. 

"How dare you... how dare you..." The Duke stammered, his anger boiling over. But Bastian remained unfazed, exhaling a plume of smoke into the air.

Bastian gently rose from his seat, his movement fluid and graceful like always. He flicked the remains of his cigarette into the ashtray, then nonchalantly adjusted his hat.  "For a more refined conversation, I recommend you seek an audience with the Emperor," Bastian said coolly, offering a respectful nod before turning away. 

Duke Dissen's curses echoed behind him as the man regained his senses and smashed a nearby vase in anger. But Bastian remained unfazed, his strides purposeful and steady as he vanished from sight. He never once looked back.



As the nanny drifted into slumber, Isabelle breathed a sigh of relief. The sleeping pills had done their job, even though she had only taken a fraction of the dose, wary of any unintended consequences.

 She reached under the bed, retrieving the tightly wrapped package she had kept hidden. Within lay the carefully gathered garments of the maids, collected piece by piece over the course of many days. She couldn't simply wait for her fate to be handed over to Belov. The sense of helplessness fueled Isabelle's resolve.

Isabelle was set to handle the situation on her own. She got sleeping drugs, pretended to be intoxicated, and hid from her nanny and servants. In the course, she discovered important information during this little period of freedom, including the maids' tea break, a young maid's approaching vacation, and the frantic movement of supply carts. These tiny nuggets of information served as her stepping stones to optimism and helped her get closer to her objective of meeting her beloved Bastian.

She must meet him.

Isabelle made a pledge and quickly changed into new clothes. She made sure to place her pillows and cushions underneath the blanket to give the impression that she was sleeping.

When she was ready to flee, Isabelle approached the window with caution while pressing the brim of her simple straw hat. The nanny was still sound asleep while lying in a large chair.

The other maids who drank the drugged tea with the nanny must have experienced the same thing that Isabelle believed. 

"Forgive me, nanny" Isabelle whispered, pressing a soft kiss to the nanny's weathered cheek. “Please understand me.” Her heart ached with a blend of sadness and determination, but she willed herself to keep her tears at bay. 

This could be her final opportunity to break free, and she refused to spend the rest of her life filled with regret. With swift movements, Isabelle stuffed the money and jewelry she had carefully set aside into the worn bag of the servant. She had gathered enough supplies to last her for a sufficient amount of time, though.

Isabelle frantically rummaged through her possessions, searching for anything of value to help fund her escape. She desperately wished she could have procured more valuable trinkets, but her limited mobility had made it near impossible. 

With a heavy heart, she carefully placed the few items she had managed to gather, along with a heartfelt apology note, into her worn satchel. She hesitated for a moment as she gazed upon the glittering engagement ring from Prince Belov, but with a determined heart, she left it behind. She wouldn't let anyone, not even the prince to blemish the pure love she had for Bastian.

Her heart pounding with excitement and nerves, Isabelle tightly clutched her bag and approached the bedroom door. 

It was now 11 PM, and the back gate of the Summer Palace would soon be opening. This was her only chance, the moment she had been eagerly waiting for, and she wasn't going to let it go.

Chapter 22.

Traces of Violence.





"Ah, the beauty of youth," Dr. Kramer beamed, as he neatly tucked away the chart. "Not a single red flag to be found. This checkup was a mere formality, just like the one last month." The doctor marveled at the remarkable progress his patient had made since his last visit. The surgery on his left shoulder, to extract shrapnel, was a distant memory, and the telltale signs of a previous gunshot wound were almost imperceptible. 

"You're good to serve in the front lines again, but I wouldn't advise it," Dr. Kramer warned, as he leaned leisurely against his desk. Bastian, however, was unfazed and merely flashed a grin before getting dressed. Scars, big and small, littered his body like a roadmap of battles fought and won, but with a deft hand, he expertly covered them with a smartly pressed dress shirt. Though, the scars disappeared, but the warrior within remained.

"I have faith that the Admiralty shall only be privy to the bare facts, devoid of any personal biases," Bastian stated, as he meticulously fastened his cufflinks. Though a smile graced his lips, it was one of mere politeness, a fleeting facade to mask his unwavering resolve to venture forth once more.

"Bastian," Dr. Kramer sighed, his voice carrying a note of concern.

He initially encountered Bastian in this medical clinic on a late spring day like today. The air carried the aroma of roses as it drifted through the open window on a weekend afternoon.

Bastian, Sophia's son, looked just like her late husband Jeff Klauswitz, the man who had killed her. However, Bastian's inability to avoid a fate similar to that of his mother made Dr. Kramer even less optimistic.

Carl Illis stormed into the hospital, his grandson Bastian in tow, determined to unearth evidence of foul play. With fire in his eyes and tears in his voice, he spoke of how he had just rescued Sophia's son from a dangerous household. The old man declared Bastian as the newest member of the Illis family, vowing to protect the child from any further harm.

This was a feud that had simmered for years, ever since Sophia's passing. The Klauswitz aimed to eliminate Bastian, the surviving son of their late daughter-in-law, while Carl sought to honor his daughter's memory by making Bastian his heir. In the end, the Klauswitz emerged victorious much to Carl's frustration.

Dr. Kramer, tasked with examining Bastian that fateful day, was taken aback by the twist of events. Twice over, he was left stunned by the family drama that had played out before him.

As little Bastian was undressed, Dr. Kramer was greeted with a shocking sight. The boy's body was covered in a tapestry of scars, both old and new, testament to a life lived on the edge. Recent wounds, inflicted by a ferocious wild dog, were still raw and red, a painful reminder of Bastian's bravery.

But it was the story behind the scars that truly took the doctor's breath away. Bastian regaled tales of tumbles from horses, sword-fighting mishaps, and daredevil hikes gone awry. Each scar was a badge of honor, a symbol of his daring spirit.

Or so it seemed on the surface. For in reality, these scars were far from accidental. Each one was inflicted during the "successor class", a twisted excuse for the abuse of young Bastian by those who sought to break him. 

"You've earned your stripes on the battlefield, my boy," Dr. Kramer said, removing his spectacles and rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Why not hang up your sword and retire? I cannot in good conscience sign the papers that would send you back into harm's way." The doctor sighed heavily, the weight of his responsibility evident on his shoulders.

"Peacekeeping and vigilance always come first, even on the frontlines," Bastian declared confidently, leaning against the desk. The spring sunlight filtered in, casting a golden glow over the two of them as they locked eyes.

"It's quite remarkable, considering the state you returned in," Dr. Kramer noted.

"Ah, but that was an exceptional situation," Bastian replied,

"And what if, heaven forbid, something like that happens again?" Dr. Kramer asked, concern etched on his face.

Bastian chuckled, "Why, I'll just get myself another medal for bravery, of course."

Dr. Kramer let out a hearty laugh at Bastian's audacious quip.

Bastian wore a peaceful smile, but his eyes remained unreadable, just as they had been 14 years prior.

Despite Carl Illis's tireless efforts to bring the Klauswitz couple to justice for their cruel and hidden abuse of his daughter's son, he never saw the fruits of his labors. The cunning perpetrators had covered their tracks, leaving behind not a shred of evidence of their wrongdoing.

They masked their abuse behind the guise of "Succession Education," hiding behind a grandiose facade.

With lightning speed, Jeff Klauswitz tied the knot again after the untimely passing of his former spouse. His new bride soon gave birth to a premature baby in the seventh month of their marriage, but that didn't stop Jeff from putting his ex-wife's son front and center as his heir apparent. This bold move was his attempt to silence the whispers and dispel the dark clouds that had descended upon him following a mysterious occurrence.

The Klauswitz couple tasked a select group of highly acclaimed educators to mold Bastian Klauswitz, their prized heir, into the perfect successor.  Though the expertise was undeniable, the training was a ruthless regimen that pushed the child beyond his limits. 

As dawn broke, the young heir was already awake, dressed in pristine attire, ready to begin his day. The heavy workload and grueling physical training, reminiscent of military boot camp, left no room for rest.

As a child, Bastian Klauswitz lived a life of relentless hardships. His days were filled with an endless stream of reading and writing, until his eyes were bloodshot and his hands swollen. 

Despite falling off a horse and nearly breaking his neck, he pushed through and mastered the art of horseback riding. At night, he was left to fend for himself in the forest, armed with only a gun in his still-developing hand. 

Success meant a return to the cold, quiet emptiness, but failure meant a questioning of his very existence. For six long years, from the death of his mother to the day he arrived at the hospital with his grandfather, Bastian was trapped within the walls of the Klauswitz family, struggling to survive in a world filled with relentless challenges.

"Your efforts are futile, my boy," Dr. Kramer declared with a sad smile. "The Admiralty's verdict will remain unchanged and I won't be signing any papers till fall. My hands are tied." 

The truth behind Sophia's death weighed heavy on Dr. Kramer's conscience. If only he had kept it shrouded in secrecy, Carl Illis wouldn't have been consumed by vengeance. But now, it was too late for regrets. The path of revenge, once set in motion, was now an insurmountable task for the young Bastian.

With a heavy heart, Dr. Kramer donned his glasses and gazed upon Bastian. The memories of the past weighed heavily on the doctor's mind, as he beheld the young man before him.

Every act of violence leaves a mark, and the invisible abuse inflicted upon Bastian was no exception. Despite his best efforts, Carl Illis was unable to bring the Klauswitz couple to justice and finally, tears of anger and frustration streamed down his face. Through it all, young Bastian stood by his side, steadfast and unperturbed, a silent guardian to his grieving grandfather. As Bastian and Carl Illis stepped out of the medical room, Dr. Kramer couldn't help but notice the scars left behind by the quiet torment he endured. 

"What do you think about settling down, finding a partner and starting a family?” In a sudden moment of impulsiveness, Dr. Kramer posed a question, “I'm not suggesting you accept the Emperor's arranged marriage, there are many other eligible women. Try to find someone who you love, not just a transaction." 

"I'll consider it, thank you for the advice." Bastian replied with a smile, 

Although the doctor was aware that he didn't intend it, he was at a loss for words. Dr. Kramer suddenly thought it was absurd to offer such counsel when he had long since buried the unmet love in his heart.

Bastian gave his customary gracious goodbye. The doctor's office was engulfed in a lazy afternoon silence following the last appointment.

Dr. Kramer gazed out the window, his eyes fixed on Bastian's departure. The young man strode confidently forward, his jacket slung over one arm and his gaze unwavering. Despite his simple attire, his posture was that of a seasoned soldier, commanding and sure. 

As the golden rays of the spring sun danced through his blonde hair, Dr. Kramer watched him until he was nothing more than a distant memory. In silence, he marveled at the grace and poise of the young man who had just left his sight.



Odette spun on her heel and peered at her reflection in the window of the café across the street. With her hair styled and her blouse and skirt neatly pressed, she appeared presentable, but not quite fit for a formal occasion. The appointment was far too pressing to wait for Countess Trier's assistance.

Her mind raced as she wondered where Bastian was headed and what he had planned. The letter from Bastian, sent via personal courier the night before, contained only a cryptic note specifying the time and place of their meeting:

 "We will meet tomorrow at 3 PM in front of the fountain in City Hall Square."

The curt, final greeting of just the letter "K" did little to ease her growing unease.

It wasn't like she was heading to a fancy party, judging by the time and location. She made sure to dress appropriately, but as her appointment time drew near, she began to feel nervous.

Suddenly, a black car appeared from across the street, slowing down and finally coming to a stop near the fountain. Odette watched warily, noting that it was not the same car that she had arrived in that day. She steeled herself, ready for whatever lay ahead.

"Lady Odette." 

Bastian's voice echoed through the busy street, jolting Odette out of her thoughts.  She looked up to see a sleek black car rolling to a stop beside her, and out stepped the man she had been waiting for. 

Confidently, Bastian stride towards her, his piercing gaze unwavering as the bustling crowds of onlookers seemed to fade into the background.

 "Hello, Captain." Odette greeted him politely, trying to hide the surprise in her voice. Bastian stopped in front of her, his eyes sizing her up from head to toe. He scrutinized her with a cold, calculated gaze, leaving no detail unnoticed. The intensity of his scrutiny sent shivers down her spine.

With a haughty leer, Bastian cast his eyes upon Odette, his evaluation of her blatant and infused with aristocratic disdain. And with a smirk that hinted at his thoughts, he offered her his hand, inviting her to follow him.

Confused and caught off guard, Odette gazed at him in disbelief, searching for an explanation for his sudden appearance. But as Bastian deftly took her parasol and tucked it away, she found herself being swept towards the waiting car, her mind racing to make sense of what was happening. And as she settled into the plush seat of the vehicle, she realized with a start that she had just become Bastian's latest conquest.

"Where are we headed?" Odette bravely inquired, but Bastian disregarded her question with a silent shut of the car door. With a furrowed brow, she watched as he calmly settled into the seat next to her, unfazed by his rude behavior. The driver respectfully opened the opposite back door for him, and Bastian slid into the car with composed ease.

"Let’s go." Bastian's voice, calm and collected, echoed through the car as the driver begins the journey without question. "We'll be around shortly," With a hint of insincerity, he offers Odette the parasol, which she gracefully accepts, concealing any trace of discontentment. 

As she was admiring the intricate design etched upon the parasol, the vehicle weaved through the bustling city streets. The car pulled up to its final stop just as Odette discovered a loose strand of lace adorning her hem. Swiftly, she tucked it away. As she looked up, she saw Bastian's hand reach out, offering her a glimpse into a world of glamour and opulence. 

The shop windows of the esteemed Sabine dress shop sparkled like stars before her, recollecting the memory of the clever test that the Count Brand's daughter had posed to her.

 


Chapter 23.

 Beggar Princess.



"It has been quite some time, Bastian," Madame Sabine greeted with a warm smile that illuminated her face like a star lit sky. "Your aunt's message was a delightful surprise, and I must say, I am honored to be in your presence once again."

Bastian, filled with delight, embraced her without a moment's hesitation.  "Your kindness knows no bounds, Madam Sabine," He expressed with gratitude. "I cannot express enough how thankful I am for your gracious assistance."

"Fear not, my dear Bastian," Madame Sabine exclaimed, giving him a fleeting peck on the cheek. "Maria's nephew is as much my own as blood could make him." And with that, she turned her gaze upon Lady Odette, who stood a pace behind Bastian.

 "A thousand welcomes, Lady Odette," she said joyously, her eyes beaming with warmth. "It is a privilege to extend my hospitality and offer my services to one so fair and refined." A brilliant smile illuminated her features, banishing any traces of coolness that may have momentarily gripped her countenance.

Madame Sabine greeted Bastian and Odette with grace and then led them to the reception hall at the back of the mansion. It was there that an array of beautiful garments and fabrics were elegantly displayed, their vibrant colors and textures beckoning to be admired. As Odette stepped inside, she was struck by the full extent of the grandeur that surrounded her, realizing only then the magnitude of the situation she was in.

"Should we start with the fittings and work our way up to the intricate details of design?" Madame Sabine inquired with a tone both extremely polite and purposeful.

"Forgive me, Madam Sabine," Odette stammered, coming to a halt with an apologetic smile. "It seems there has been a misunderstanding. I did not come here with the intent of having my garments altered. I simply believed this to be a place where one might pay their respects to the Captain's acquaintance."

"Pardon me, could you grant us a brief intermission?" Bastian interjected Odette's speech with a polite request, to which, Madam Sabine cheerfully agreed with a nod, 

"Take your time, I'll be here. Just give me a signal when you're done." She lightly touched Bastian's shoulder before departing with the team.

The reception area was pin drop silent when the door was shut from the outside with just the two of them inside.

“That was extremely disrespectful.” Odette broke the silence by speaking first, voluntarily. With that, Bastian turned his head to see her sassy face.

"Lady Odette, it seems to me that this is something for which to be grateful, not criticized."

“Grateful? I'm sorry.” Odette retorted with a question in an utter shock. She put on a brave face, but her quivering eyes gave away her unease.

"Unfortunately, this establishment is fully booked until the spring," Bastian informed her, "It's only thanks to my aunt's close friendship with Madam Sabine that we were granted this rare opportunity."

 "No matter how enchanting this place may be, I have no interest in accepting gifts from the captain. The notion of being compelled into receiving something is...simply inedible." Odette replied, her voice tinged with a hint of distaste.

"A gift. Do you really believe I'm going to all this trouble to give you a gift?”  Bastian's calm, solemn voice erupted with emotion like a lava for the first time. Even the barest amount of decency was destroyed by the scathing mockery he brutally displayed.

Odette was struck with speechlessness as she remained still, her eyes as big and round as saucers. While looking across at the seat in front of him, Bastian gently turned around and sat back down on the plush hospitality sofa. Odette resisted Bastian's arrogant request by remaining motionless.

Bastian lifted the crystal glass from the table while cocking his head in a show of disdain. The sound of the translucent glass striking the ice reverberated throughout the space.

"I have no interest in trifling possessions," Bastian declared, wetting his lips with a sip of icy whiskey soda. He leisurely crossed his legs, the bright light glinting off his highly polished shoes, piercing Odette's hazy gaze. "I demand nothing but the finest for myself, the priciest, the most luxurious, always. And, of course, Lady Odette is included in this standard."

"What's the point when I'm nothing but a charade?" Odette spat out, the sting of the captain's words still fresh in her mind. “You said that the entire event is just a prologue to Princess Isabelle's wedding.” 

Despite the cruel insult, Odette held her composure, her eyes flashing with righteous anger. Her heart was her sanctum, and she wouldn't let that unrepentant man sully it. It was the one shred of dignity she had managed to cling to, and she wouldn't surrender it to him, this easily.

"So, let me get this straight, you're saying that this decision to move forward with the marriage proposal was made with the awareness of the potential for rumors and damage to one's reputation, correct?" 

"I couldn't care less about the honor and dignity of a gentleman.” Bastian said, taking a sip of his whiskey soda. “So, you take pride in your noble ancestry, but for me it's all about the dough.” He pulled out a handkerchief from his jacket pocket and dabbed at the sweat on his fingers. "But, tell me, how do you think this will affect my standing in society? I mean, the whole world will soon know you as my bride. What if they discover that you don't even own a single piece of respectable clothing?"

Odette's eyes narrowed. "I see your point. But when I go to official events, I always make sure to dress appropriately. And I fully want to keep doing so.”

"Your attire is always a reflection of your grace and poise, Lady Odette," Bastian said as he delicately placed the used handkerchief on the table.  “And I know that you will continue to do so with the same elegance and impeccable style. I admire your commitment." He gazed up at her, taking in the sight of her pallid complexion, the glistening of unshed tears in her eyes, and the unwavering resolve etched on her features.

"Allow me to be candid." Bastian said, his brow furrowed as he regarded her unkempt appearance. "The outcome of our previous endeavors was far from satisfactory. And I must admit, I have no interest in being associated with the title that precedes your name. It's a task, not a privilege. I believe that paints a clearer picture, wouldn't you agree?"

He sighed, the memory of her father's avaricious motives clouding his thoughts. But he supposed that's the reality of the situation. The notion of a beggar princess and her scheming father trying to extort money from him, it's all rather disenchanting.

Lady Odette's life was a tangled mess, much more so than Bastian had initially perceived. As the truth dawned on him, a glimmer of self-reproach crossed his face. He had been tasked with caring for this woman, but he had underestimated the extent of her troubles.

But Bastian was not one to be deterred by a challenge. The realization only strengthened his resolve. He would have preferred to pay the price for betraying the emperor, but he had no regrets about his decision. It was a choice he had made, and he would not let it tarnish his honor.

Bastian went out to find a solution since he was determined to make things right. He was certain that he possessed the tools necessary to remove the stain from his dignity and redeem his reputation. He was eager to get through this narrow setback because it was only temporary.

Odette lifted her gaze after a prolonged examination of the worn tips of her shoes. Her eyes, now devoid of tears but rimmed with red, met Bastian's. The oddity of her youthful visage contrasted with the aura of despair that surrounded her was striking, especially given her lack of cosmetics.

"Is it not something we must both endure and comprehend?" she said, her voice tinged with resignation.

"Forgive me, but I too detest that moniker that belittles the captain," Odette said, her tone motherly as she scolded Bastian. A slight smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he regarded her stern expression. Despite the gravity of the moment, she possessed an unexpected wit that never failed to bring a smile to his face.

"I kept my dislike for it concealed because I believed it was my duty in my role," she continued. "I hope the captain can exhibit a similar sense of decorum."

"The grandson of a junk dealer, I suppose there's not much I can do about it. But with Lady Odette, isn't it different?" Bastian lifted his shoulders in a nonchalant shrug. "Let's focus on solving the problems that can be solved. There's no use in lamenting over what's out of reach."

With a graceful gait for someone of his size and build, Bastian rose from his seat and approached Odette. "I will fulfill my duty and Lady Odette will fulfill hers. Nothing more to it," he stated firmly.

Odette stiffened at his words, unable to offer a retort. But Bastian seemed unfazed by her silence, as if it didn't matter.

"Bow low when you must, for that is true honor," Bastian proclaimed, spinning around to face Odette. Despite her efforts to mask it, disdain was written all over her face. She clung onto the remnants of her dignity, refusing to let it crumble and run away in that moment. As she struggled to regain her composure, Bastian summoned the staff outside the waiting room with a wave of his hand.

"Pardon the disruption," Bastian gracefully acknowledged, as he settled back into his plush sofa. Odette remained in place, observing the dream-like scene unfold. With leisure, Bastian delved into his horse racing magazine, while the staff bustled with activity. 

The stage was set, and the doll play began.



As Odette stepped onto the podium, the light from the chandelier above danced upon her form, illuminating her delicate frame swathed in a sheer muslin gown. The assistants holding the tape measure were struck by her beauty, as they had already known she was a pretty woman, but the reality exceeded their expectations.

Madame Sabine, the grand couture herself, stepped back with a sense of awe, surveying the scene before her. Odette's statuesque figure was a sight to behold, with her slender curves and clear skin captivating those around her. Her upright posture only added to her natural allure, a sight that could drive any man to madness.

Social elites, renowned performers, and influential mistresses would barter their riches and reputation for a mere glimpse of true beauty. Madam Sabine, a seasoned tailor to the most illustrious women in the empire, had beheld many a fair damsel in her time.

 However, Odette's impeccable visage and elegant poise stood out amidst the sea of beauty. The tailor, armed with her tape measure, marveled at the harmonious proportions she called out, while an attendant meticulously recorded each number with reverence. 

Odette, a humble woman of modest means, astounded them all with her quiet grace and cooperative spirit, defying all expectations. Her poised demeanor was a testament to the true essence of beauty, surpassing even the greatest treasures of wealth and power.

"The final stitch has been made." The tailor's voice echoed through the tranquil room, breaking the hush. 

"Gracious thanks." Odette rises with elegant poise, ready to return to the changing room. Madam Sabine nods with a pleased grin, fully comprehending the captivating charm that is Odette. Her every movement only adds to her already breathtaking beauty, illuminating why Bastian is so smitten.

Odette appeared once again, her tattered attire a stark contrast to the opulence of the room. Impatient, Madame Sabine whisked her into the reception room, eager to begin the next phase of their plan.

Bastian sat in the same wing chair, magazine in hand, as the duo entered the room. With a flick of her wrist, Madame Sabine summoned a team of assistants carrying bolts of luxurious fabrics. Bastian closed his magazine, fixing his attention on the women.

"Now, let's delve into the details," Madame Sabine said, her voice ringing with excitement. Maria Gross had expressed her concerns about Bastian's true intentions, but Madame Sabine was confident in her ability to gauge a man's character through his expenditures. Decades of running a dress shop had honed her skills to a fine science.

She was certain that the money a man spent on a woman was a clear indication of his intentions. And she was eager to uncover the truth behind Bastian's actions.


Chapter 24.

 His Real Lover.



As the sun set, Bastian Klauswitz had completed a hefty shopping list. He meticulously picked out every item from 1 to 10. Odette, meanwhile, merely shadowed his steps, dutifully taking measurements and serving as his silent muse. The finishing touches included fashionable extras such as hats, gloves, and shoes.

"Ah, wait!" Madame Sabine halted the duo as they rose from their seats. Digging through a mound of silk and chiffon, she discovered a lost pen. "Lady Odette, may I have your address so I may inform you when your order is ready?" she asked, her eyes twinkling with a hint of excitement at the prospect of delivering the much-anticipated attire.

Odette calmly accepted the pen from Madame Sabine and said, "Indeed, Ma'am. “ As the sun slowly fell below the horizon, the sound of the nib scraping on the paper filled the dressing room's warm warmth. Odette handed over the address book and made a polite request, "This is the address of a reliable relative who manages my affairs." Despite the brief appearance of surprise, Madame Sabine politely held off on asking any additional questions.

"Shall we depart?" Bastian rose from his seat, offering Odette his hand with a debonair smile. Despite her inner turmoil, Odette took his hand without hesitation. After all, this was not just any ordinary business transaction, but a delicate dance of duties and responsibilities. She was determined not to fall behind, or be in debt to Bastian in any way.

With a firm resolve, Odette clasped Bastian's proffered arm and stepped out of the dressing room. The team of discreet attendants, who had carefully packed their ready-to-go items, followed silently in tow. The trunk and passenger seat of the opulent vehicle overflowed with the first installment of their order, a mere fraction of the grand plan they had set in motion.

The staff bid farewell with gracious goodbyes as they loaded the final bags into the vehicle. The pedestrians who had gathered to admire the grand parade of sumptuous gift boxes, now hastened to follow in its wake.

“It will be difficult for us to eat dinner together because I have a prior commitment."  Bastian started talking while everything was quiet.

As she looked upon Bastian, Odette's countenance was devoid of any hint of emotion. It was as though she had already anticipated and rejected a dinner invitation before it had even been extended. Determined to keep her feelings in check, Odette mustered the courage to firmly decline Bastian's offer, even if it meant spending the evening alone.

"Step back into the vehicle, Lady Odette. Hans will escort you home." Bastian spoke with a firm voice.

"But what about you, Captain?" Odette asked, looking up at him.

"I'll stroll on over. The destination is just a stone's throw away and it's quicker that way," Bastian replied, nodding towards a grand edifice across the bustling street. The Reinfeld Hotel, a place where their tumultuous first encounter had taken place.

Before Odette could utter a word, the chauffeur stepped forward, holding open the car door with a courteous smile. Though the thought was unsettling, there seemed to be no way to decline. It would be foolish to attempt lugging all that luggage on her own, anyway. The more she pondered, the more absurd the notion became.

With a graceful dip of her head, Odette expressed her gratitude. "Thank you, Captain." She stood with her hands demurely clasped, showing her appreciation.

In a mere matter of hours, the Captain had lavished more on her than the Dyssen family could spend in an entire year. While he may have claimed it was for his own appearance and prestige, the truth was, everything was being given to Odette.

Odette reluctantly bent in submission, her mind trying to avoid thoughts of Bastian's enigmatic emotions. The atmosphere was extremely heavy with an unspoken tension, and she yearned to escape it at all costs. She quickly straightened herself, eager to break the awkward silence. With a burst of determination, she hastened towards the car. 

Bastian moved with fluid grace, just as the driver settled into his seat and revved the engine to life. Suddenly, a sharp rap on the window caused the driver to jump in surprise. He spun around to see Bastian, with a commanding presence, leaning against the car's window.

"Unload every last piece of luggage at the Dyssen residence before you depart," Bastian commanded, with a melodious voice through the partially open car window. "These gifts are sure to impress even the most discerning Duke. Don't you agree, Lady Odette?"

With his eyes gleaming like diamonds in the waning light, Bastian fixed his attention on the startled Odette. Her breath caught in her throat at the warmth emanating from his smile, as soft as a June breeze.

"Agreeing," Odette reassured the man with a voice devoid of feeling. Despite the embarrassment and discomfort that lingered, like the prick of a thousand needles, she couldn't deny the truth in Bastian's words. "No need to fret," she continued, "I was set to follow the Captain's command to a tee."

"Excellent, Lady Odette, your way with words is a blessing," Bastian said, his posture erect and proud. With a graceful bow of his head, he signaled his intention to depart. 

Odette, lost in thought, gazed at her fingertips, only to be jolted from her reverie as the vehicle took a sharp turn onto a bustling street. The city was alive with activity on this bustling weekend evening, a sea of people and carriages, now joined by the growing throngs of automobiles. Her abode was within spitting distance, but the gridlocked main street seemed to stretch on forever. That's when the man offered a solution, suggesting they alight and hoof it. 

"Ah, today's the day of a star-studded opera performance," the driver mused, stealing a glance at the rear-view mirror. "Traffic's a nightmare, but with a cast of renowned vocalists, it's no wonder the show is a hit."

"Do not worry, I am in excellent shape," Odette smiled weakly, her gaze fixed on the street beyond the car window. As the leisurely rolling vehicle finally approached the grand Reinfeld Hotel, she caught sight of Bastian waiting outside. 

He was soon joined by a sleek black car, just as opulent as the one Odette was in, and without hesitation, Bastian stepped forward to assist a lady from the vehicle. Odette couldn't help but recognize the regal, red-haired woman, Sandrine, the Countess Lenart, who held a special place in Bastian's heart as his true paramour.



"Sandrine seems to be growing increasingly restless," Duke Laviere spoke, his tone measured and reserved. "However, I long for the two of you to come together in a way that is graceful and complete." Time had passed, and the Duke's demeanor was vastly different from when they had discussed the intricate details of their joint venture's railway operations and stock portfolio.

"I also think the same," Bastian replied with alacrity, assuaging the Duke's concerns. Laviere, who had been a ball of nerves throughout dinner, finally erupted in peals of laughter, his tension finally dissipating.

"I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed by your unwavering composure," Duke Laviere enthused, finally able to voice his worries about his daughter. "You possess the kind of level-headedness that acts as a sturdy bulwark against Sandrine's emotional tendencies." Dinner had been interrupted by Sandrine's impulsive behavior, but now, the Duke could freely express his anxieties.

Bastian kept quiet as he listened. Even though the Duke's distinctive accent made it difficult for him to comprehend, he decided against asking.

Duke Laviere had no intention of extending mercy to the homosexual ex-husband of his daughter, Sandrine. He had destroyed her life through a fraudulent marriage and retribution would come in the form of maximum alimony. Remarriage would only be possible after this matter was dealt with. 

"Kindly comprehend the stance of our family and exercise patience," Duke Laviere implored.

Ultimately, this was the crux of the matter and Bastian was in broad agreement. The small price he had to pay was a trifle compared to the immense reward that lay ahead. 

"My sincerest thanks for safeguarding my daughter's dignity," Duke Laviere sincerely expressed his appreciation, after their lengthy discussion.

Honor was a word  seemed vastly inappropriate for Sandrine. 

She saw her husband's male lover as a weakness, demanded a divorce, and was openly pursuing the next man. Sandrine was now likely lying in the arms of her latest lover, gossiping about her father and her remarried partner Bastian, who remained blissfully unaware of her true intentions.

Her current flame was a substitute singer at the opera house, just like the unknown painter from last season and the dancer from the suburban theater before that. These third-rate artists were all mediocre in talent and youth, but ultimately harmless. 

The public was well aware of Sandrine's escapades and it was a minor deviation accepted with the silent approval of society. Bastian shared this view, seeing it as a trivial matter.

Sandrine was a woman of exceptional wit, and she understood the true nature of love and relationships. She was a refreshing departure from the emotional and problematic women he had encountered before, and Bastian was grateful for her unique perspective. 

Despite her many lovers, he knew that her love for him was genuine and that it transcended the physical bonds she shared with other men. He was also aware that her love for him was true and existed in a separate universe from the men who warmed her bed.

With a heart overflowing with gratitude, Bastian thanked the Duke Laviere for his understanding and acceptance of Bastian's friendship with the Duke's beloved daughter. "I am sincerely thankful to the Duke for acknowledging and valuing my bond with your daughter."

As the Duke took his leave, memories of that fateful day came rushing back, cast in the warm glow of the streetlamps that illuminated the city at night. The image of Odette's father, so filled with love for his only daughter, was at the forefront of Bastian's mind.

Duke Dyssen was a heartless and unfeeling father, who cared little for his daughter. He was skilled in the art of deceit and would sell his daughter to the highest bidder without a second thought.

As Bastian wandered the streets at night, his thoughts turned to Lady Odette. He wondered if her life would have been any different had she been blessed with a loving and supportive father. It was impossible to imagine Odette living a life like Sandrine's.

Despite her father's shortcomings, Odette von Dyssen was not one to be taken advantage of. She was not the type to devise a scheme and fight back against those who wronged her. Instead, she would endure the injustice with grace, much like she had put up with her father's numerous flaws for so long.

She put on a facade of being aloof on such matters, but in reality, she was a woman of great reputation who shone brighter than anyone else.

By the time Bastian's thoughts had taken him down that path, he had already arrived at the corner of the road where his house stood. And that was when a gut feeling told him that something was amiss.

The sight that greeted him confirmed his suspicion - a large group of police officers were milling about near his townhouse, and there were far too many of them to be just a routine patrol. The horses, especially, drew his attention. One horse, in particular, with its fine stallion and saddle, stood out from the rest. This was no ordinary police horse, but one reserved for the royal kings guard.

Bastian's fears were confirmed as soon as the door to his townhouse was opened. In the wake of the recent ball, where the imperial princess had caused a stir, suspicious individuals had taken to prowling around his home. The presence of the kings guard was a clear indication that something was happening wrong. 

It was Admiral Demel who caught wind of the truth - that they were the undercover Imperial Guard. He warned Bastian that the Emperor had his eyes fixed on him and advised him to steer clear of the princess.

A heavy silence settled over him as he wondered why the Emperor was taking such an interest in him now. With a deep breath, Bastian reached for the doorbell, suppressing the unanswerable questions that threatened to boil over.

A few moments later, the door swung open, revealing the pale butler, Lovis.

"Master, there is a serious problem!" Lovis's hand shook wildly on the doorknob. "Her Highness, the Princess has arrived...," his voice trailed off, but Bastian didn't need any further clarification. The gravity of the situation was all too clear.

"Bastian!" A young woman dressed in maid's attire burst forth from behind Lovis, and to Bastian's shock, it was none other than Isabelle, the Emperor's troublesome daughter.


Chapter 25.

 Where the Arrow Is Pointing.



Bastian let out a deep, throaty chuckle that echoed through the entrance hall like a peal of thunder. 

His eyes, as still and peaceful as a mountain lake, locked onto Isabelle's, and a sly smirk played at the corners of his lips. It was not a friendly expression though, and Isabelle felt herself shrink back, her feet frozen in place like an ice berg. 

She stood before Bastian, just close enough to feel the chill radiating from his piercing gaze. He cast a cursory glance at the bustle of the entrance hall, then, with a single, crisp nod of his head, he summoned the butler, who cowered behind him. The butler, sensing Bastian's intent, scurried to close the door, and the hall was consumed by a deafening silence, broken only by the sound of Bastian's amused breathing.

Bastian, with a flick of his wrist, halted the scurrying servants who sought to flee the scene. He advanced towards Isabelle, his steps purposeful and determined. Isabelle's heart, once filled with excitement, now turned to ice as she met his cold gaze. 

"We're going to the imperial palace," Bastian declared, his voice devoid of any warmth or welcome. "Come with me." The words, spoken with such brutal efficiency, sent a torrent of tears streaming down Isabelle's cheeks. She was overwhelmed with emotion at this reunion marked by such cruel disregard.

"No, I won’t comply," Isabelle cried out, her hands shaking as she clutched onto Bastian's sleeve. "I have escaped that place, and traveled a weary road to reach here. You know nothing of the trials I have endured."

“Sure, it appears so," Bastian sneered, his lip curling into a contemptuous smirk.

The confusion that had once graced Isabelle's features as a disguised princess was now replaced by disdain. Bastian couldn't fathom what could have possibly driven the princess to embark on such a foolish endeavor, or how she had mustered the resources to make it a reality. He felt a twinge of pity for both the emperor, who would soon be embroiled in this mess, and the crown prince of Belov, who was doomed to marry the mad princess for the sake of his kingdom.

"You are sought after, and the emperor's arrival is imminent," Bastian warned, his voice stern. "You must depart before he arrives."

"Bastian, I beg of you, speak truth to me," Isabelle pleaded, her voice taking on a stubborn edge. "Do you still see me as a child? I comprehend that I may have appeared thus when we first met, but I assure you, those days are long gone."

Isabelle tossed her hat with a flourish, and it landed with a dramatic clatter on the marble floor. "Look at me, Bastian," she declared, her voice ringing with determination. "I am no longer a child, but a woman fully grown. And I am ready to sacrifice my crown for you, without hesitation!"

"Your Highness, what concern is it of mine whether you be a child or a woman?" Bastian gazed upon Isabelle, his eyes shining with innocence. 

"Is it because of your royal station? The disparity in our ranks? Is that why you cannot look within and consider your heart's desires?" Isabelle asked, her voice laced with frustration.

"Being a princess is a heavy burden, Bastian," she said, her voice rife with dramatics. "How I yearn to cast off this title, if only I could." Isabelle indulged in a performance of heart-wrenching grief, playing the role of the tragic heroine.

Isabelle, had always lived a life of privilege, appeared to be unfamiliar with the concept of rejection. She was a zealot, blindly convinced that the world owed her their love and adoration.

The emperor's daughter appeared to have completely disregarded the honor of her cousin Odette, who was reduced to a state of impoverishment and was desperately fighting to maintain her dignity.

Bastian loosened the knot in his tie, cocked his head, and looked down. He whispered in a whisper that only the princess could hear.

"Allow me, dear Princess, to offer a word of counsel from a place of devotion. It would serve you well to grasp onto that regal headpiece with the utmost ferocity. My demeanor, though tested in this moment, remains patient and considerate due to the reverence I hold for your status as the emperor's offspring." Bastain said

"Bastian….?" Isabelle softly spoke his name, searching for answers.

Bastian gazed upon her, a hint of admiration in his eyes. "Your Highness,  had you not been royalty, it would have been unlikely for you to stand before me with such poise and elegance."

Isabelle blinked, taken aback by his words. "I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say..."

"So, cherish the gift of your imperial lineage, Princess. Allow me to impart this wisdom." Bastian raised his head, imbuing his words with reverence. The princess's hand, clinging to his sleeve, dropped with a sense of defeat.

"No way! This can't be the end!" Isabelle panted, her voice ringing out with a desperate plea. It was clear that the towering illusion she had built for herself over the years was unbreakable. "What else would I do for you? I took a chance and left everything behind, all for you. Don't do this to me, Bastian! Please, have mercy!"

"Your Highness, my heart belongs solely to the imperial family as a loyal soldier. This steadfast devotion has been unyielding and shall remain thus. The truth you so eagerly sought, this is it." With a collected demeanor, Bastian righted the cufflinks disturbed by the princess, sealing the fate of their relationship with a reserved air.

The sound of the mansion's doorbell echoed through the halls, jolting Isabelle from her dazed state. She stumbled, as if she had forgotten how to even shed a tear. 

With cool composure, Bastian answered the door to find a group of Imperial Guards disguised as police officers, taken aback at the sight of the princess being supported by the servants.

“Her Royal Highness is here,” Bastian proclaimed, breaking the stunned silence. The guards' expressions were a mix of shock and confusion at the unexpected appearance of Isabelle.

“I had intended to escort her back to the imperial palace, but now that you've arrived, I'll entrust her to your capable hands." Bastian declared, gesturing towards the disheveled princess. 

"Captain Klauswitz, accompany us at once.” The senior officer, commanding with authority, commanded, “You are instructed to arrive at the palace as quickly and discretely as possible."



"I'm grateful, sister. Thank you a lot! “Tira threw herself at Odette, embracing her, excited and speechless.

They had just set up to go on a weekend picnic together after a full week of pleading and begging.

With a gentle smile gracing her face, Odette laid down the ladle she had been using to stir the bubbling stew. Her sister Tira was an endless font of excitement and energy, her eyes alight with wonder as she recounted out all the marvels she had heard about the new amusement park in the city center. 

Cotton candy and merry-go-rounds, the Electric Palace and horoscope machines, even the towering Ferris wheel - Tira's voice was overflowing with enthusiasm and eagerness as she recounted all the exciting tales she had heard from her schoolmates. In the face of such youthful excitement, Odette couldn't help but give in, her heart softening to her sister's unbridled joy.

“Don't forget, the date is next Sunday.” Tira chimed in with excitement, extending her pinky finger for emphasis. It was her secret way of securing promises. Odette, with a smile, entwined her finger with Tira's, assuring her. 

However, deep down she hoped that the man who had been bothering her lately wouldn't contact her again. If he did, she made a silent vow not to answer his calls.

"It's a blessing that Father didn't return, isn't it?" Tira beamed with a childlike innocence as she took a seat at the dinner table. Though she knew her words were offensive, Odette found herself unable to scold her. After all, her own feelings mirrored Tira's.

With a dreamy gaze fixed upon the vacant chair that once belonged to their father, Odette proposed an adventure to her sister, "Imagine a world beyond these four walls, just you and I exploring uncharted territories after graduation.”

Contrary to what Odette had hoped, Tira's face displayed a look of reluctance. "Do we really have to leave?" she questioned. "Can't we just find a cozy home here and make a life for just the two of us?" 

"The bustling capital city is too hectic, and the cost of living is sky-high. A quaint little town might be just what we need for a peaceful existence," Odette countered with a gentle smile.

As Tira struggled with her thoughts, a reluctant smile graced her lips. "Uh...I'll consider it," she said, before lowering her gaze to focus on the meal before her.

The realization dawned on Odette, like a gentle summer breeze, that Tira was growing up and soon to be an independent adult. She couldn't force her sister to follow in her footsteps.

Gazing out the window at the bustling city beyond, Odette tightly gripped her glass of water, lost in thought. In due time, Tira would be ready to embark on her own journey. She would have a job, a home, and the freedom to live life on her own terms. And when that day arrived, Odette could set out on her own path, unencumbered by any obligations or expectations.

With wonder in her heart, Odette delved into the world of tutoring, discovering to her delight that it paid far more than she had ever imagined. The added perk of having her housing needs taken care of was a temptation too great to resist. Though she had no prior experience, the staff at the agency lavished her with praise, speaking highly of her skills. 

The prospect of residing in a picturesque town by the tranquil, warm southern sea filled her with a sense of longing. But just as Odette's dreams were starting to take shape, a familiar name shattered her peaceful thoughts, leaving her once again rooted in reality.

“Sister," Tira exclaimed, a twinkle in her eye. "Have you heard about mysterious Klauswitz?" Odette's grip on her glass of water tightened, her calm demeanor faltering as she asked with a hint of unease, 

"Where did you come across that name?"

With a heavy heart, Odette implored the cosmos, her words tumbling out in a desperate plea. Yet, fate once again dealt her a cruel hand, leaving her hopes dashed.

Tira nibbled on her meal, nonchalantly chattering away. "Remember when Father said Klauswitz would handle everything? Well, a visitor stopped by when you were out grocery shopping. It sounded like it had something to do with money, but I don't know the specifics. I suppose there's no news if there's nothing noteworthy, right?" 

The mention of Klauswitz set Odette's nerves on edge. The fact that her father was familiar with the man could only mean one thing, especially if it involved financial matters.

"Could you tidy up the table, please?" Odette rose from her seat, her legs barely able to support her weight.

"Going out already? So soon? Where to?" Tira asked, a hint of surprise in her voice.

"I have a meeting I overlooked. I must go," Odette replied, a hint of urgency in her tone.

"A meeting? At this hour?" Tira asked, her eyebrows raised in surprise.

"Yes. I need to return something to a relative of the imperial family," Odette explained.

"Ah! That sharp-tongued old woman," Tira said with a knowing nod.

Odette spun a web of deceit with ease, although her thoughts were muddled and confused. Thankfully, Tira readily accepted her fabricated story. With swift movements, Odette made her way out into the dark night. Her purpose was clear: to seek an audience with Bastian Klauswitz. This was the only objective that echoed in her mind.



The suffocating silence was broken by a loud slap. Bastian took a tough stance and allowed the hit to land on his cheek. The empress raised her hand once again as she prepared to strike him with her wrath, trembling with rage.

With a steely resolve, Bastian braved the impending blow as the empress, incensed and trembling with anger, thundered, "How dare you deceive my daughter!" 

Bastian calmly wiped away the crimson droplets from his wounded lips, steeling himself for the next barrage of insults and strikes. He had known the consequences of his actions, yet he never imagined the empress's wrath would be so formidable, so physically punishing.

"Steady yourselves," spoke the Emperor, who watched the tumultuous scene unfold from a distance. "In moments like these, it's important to maintain composure." With a gentle touch, he gestured for someone to guide the Empress to her bedchamber.

The emperor's command was met with swift action, as the servants surrounding the empress hastened to carry out his request. With her eyes fixed coldly on Bastian, the empress retreated, her dignity intact despite the circumstances. 

Though her actions were fueled by anger, she was still a better mother than her daughter. In the wake of the empress's departure, a profound stillness settled over the private residence, casting a shroud of silence over the space. The emperor, his face etched with a complex array of emotions, retrieved a cigarette, his gaze lingering on Bastian for an extended moment before lighting it.

As the dawn broke and news of Isabelle's escape reached the emperor's ears, a maelstrom of anger and disappointment swept over him. Bastian Klauswitz, a figure who had brought both fortune and misfortune to the empire, was the target of his fury. 

The echoes of a distant bell signaled the hour, and the emperor snuffed out his half-smoked cigarette. Slowly, he shifted his gaze towards Bastian, his eyes burning with an unspoken question.

"As the first rays of dawn creep over the horizon, Isabelle will be whisked away to foreign lands, banished from Berg's soil until her wedding day arrives. The official explanation for her hasty departure is to allow her to recuperate, for her delicate health has been shattered by neurosis and she needs time to heal before taking her vows." The Emperor sat in a leisurely manner on the sofa, his gaze fixed on the unlit fireplace, as he rubbed his tired face.

"Thank you, Your Majesty. I'll take keep it in mind." Bastian nodded with the discipline of a dedicated solider.

"We have much to discuss. Please, be seated," the emperor gestured towards the chair across from him, his demeanor weighted with weariness.


Chapter 26.

The Hound of Devil.



Bastian sat with unwavering poise, ready for his next words. His cheek still burned from the empress's blow, yet he wore an aura of serenity, a remarkable display for someone who had been summoned and berated like a felon.

 The emperor gazed upon Bastian with a furrowed brow, struggling to piece together the enigma before him. No evidence of treachery was found. The speculation that Princess Isabelle's escape would lead her to Bastian Klauswitz's abode was accurate, but beyond that, nothing else matched the assumptions.

Before the summer palace fell into disorder, Bastian sprang into action and made his way through the busy metropolis. He enjoyed a lavish meal with the influential Ratz bankers before attending a small group of people at a prestigious social club. The fact that his guests had no link to the missing Isabelle was obvious given that they were surrounded by powerful senators, bankers, and navy generals.

As the afternoon sun beat down, Bastian made his way to his doctor for a medical examination, eager to assess the injuries he sustained during the fierce battle of Trosa. With newfound energy, he then sought out the beautiful Odette, eager to continue his exciting day.

Bastian journeyed to the pinnacle of fashion and indulged the young girl in a spree of luxurious gifts. It was an awe-inspiring spectacle to behold, but what truly took everyone by surprise was the sudden appearance of Duke Laviere at Reinfeld Hotel.

Despite having a reputation for being a cunning opportunist who courted both the daughter of a Felia noble and the niece of the Emperor of Berg, it appeared that his relationship with Isabelle was totally accidental. The implications of this information caused the emperor to have a shudder down his spine.

As Bastian Klauswitz lived out a weekend of self-serving pursuits, his daughter played her own game of thievery. Under the cover of night, she slipped sleeping pills into her nanny's drink and, disguised as a maid, made a daring escape on horse-drawn cart. The Emperor's heart was heavy as he watched the tale unfold, ending in the Princess's public disgrace and embarrassment.

Despite the Emperor's knowledge of Bastian's efforts, he couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment. By keeping the Princess away, Bastian had effectively squashed any rumors and ended Isabelle's foolish infatuation, but the damage had already been done. The Emperor couldn't erase the shame brought upon their family, no matter how hard he tried to silence the whispers.

As the emperor pondered the situation, he realized that it would have been much simpler if Isabelle's actions could have been portrayed as a tragic outcome of her unrequited love from her youth. Such a scandal, though damaging to the empire's reputation, could have potentially been salvaged with time.

However, the reality of the situation was far more complicated. It was not just a problem limited to the foolish and impulsive actions of Princess Isabelle. The ambitions of the man who had captured even the heart of the Princess were now unknown, and the depth of their reach was a mystery that troubled the emperor's thoughts.

The idea that he could not even imagine the full extent of this individual's ambitions only heightened the ache in the emperor's heart.

"Ah, Captain Bastian Klauswitz, let us delve into the mysteries of your tangled love life. The First Princess of Berg, Isabelle. The Daughter of Duke Laviere, Sandrine. And the elusive Odette von Dyssen. Are there any other ladies I should be aware of, or is your heart occupied solely by these three enchantresses?" The Emperor's tone was piercing as he aimed to uncover the truth. "Who, exactly, are you, Bastian Klauswitz?"

"Your wish is my command, Your Majesty," Bastian replied with unwavering conviction. The honeyed tone of his voice and the unwavering gaze in his eyes added an air of sincerity to his smooth words, making them all the more convincing.

"Will you carry out any command I give, soldier?" The emperor asked with a hint of sarcasm in his voice, as he flicked open the cigarette box.

"Affirmative, Your Majesty," Bastian replied without a flinch, his unwavering tone befitting of a true hero.

The emperor chuckled dryly, his laughter a cutting contrast to Bastian's steadfast demeanor. "How fitting. You truly embody the title of a heroic warrior."

The Trosa Islands were jolted by the sounds of battle as the North Sea descended into anarchy. Berg was caught in the middle of a struggle for power and riches that was started by the ambitious country of Lovita.

The ships sent to inspect the surrounding waters were suddenly set ablaze, leaving the crew with no time to react. The captain, who rushed to the scene, was felled by falling debris, leaving the ship without a leader. In the midst of this chaos, a hero rose to take command. 

Bastian Klauswitz stepped up, a man of action, ready to lead the crew to victory against impossible odds. The emperor, watching in awe, recognized his bravery as he took control of the ship, guiding it through the storm of battle, cementing his place as a hero of the North Sea.

With lightning-fast reflexes, Bastian Klauswitz took command of the situation, navigating his damaged ship through the raging waves of the North Sea. Despite the odds stacked against him, he refused to surrender, instead using his ingenuity to outmaneuver the enemy fleet. As Lovita's mighty admiral charged forward, unrelenting in his pursuit of victory, Bastian saw an opportunity.

With a flick of his wrist, he deftly changed the course of his battleship, executing a daring frontal breakthrough that left the enemy fleet reeling. The panicked enemy ships were thrown into disarray as Bastian led the charge, his unwavering determination and quick thinking turning the tide of the battle. It was a moment of pure heroism, as this daring naval officer took the fight to the enemy and secured a victory for his beloved country of Berg.

Bastian Klauswitz maneuvered his battleship through the conflict with expert accuracy, dealing an immediate and severe damage to Admiral Lovita's command ship. As Klauswitz's audacious gambit penetrated the enemy ship's bow, the unrelenting bombardment ended. His methodical approach, which avoided impulsive attacks that would endanger ally ships, turned out to be a brilliant one.

With swords drawn and hearts pounding, the Berg army fought with ferocity and finesse. Amidst the chaos, the supporting fleet made their grand entrance, raining down a barrage of firepower that left the enemy forces reeling. With their line completely disrupted, the cunning and confident Captain Klauswitz made his move, apprehending the aging Admiral Lovita and accepting his white flag surrender in a triumphant victory.

The news of the Trosa Battle left the emperor in a state of stunned disbelief. While it was a victory that brought pride to the Empire, it was also a confusing and overwhelming realization. The idea of war waged on the tumultuous waves of the sea was both awe-inspiring and bewildering.

The emperor stood in awe, as if he was witnessing a page ripped straight out of the history books come to life before his very eyes. He beheld the spectacle of a naval battle unlike any he had ever imagined, with weapons that had long been relegated to the annals of military science and lore.

Grenades, swords, rifles, and pistols all clashed in a melee of steel and fire. The enemy screamed in outrage, as if Berg had unleashed the very demons of the North Sea onto their ships. It was a surreal sight, with the chaos and violence of hand-to-hand combat throwing the North Sea into a frenzy.

And yet, despite the horror and shock of it all, the emperor couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and wonder. This was a moment that would be forever etched into the annals of history, as the devil's hounds of Berg roamed the North Sea, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.

The thought echoed in the Emperor's mind, like a haunting melody. If the one behind the glorious victory at the Battle of Trosa had been on the other side, 

What kind of terror could he have unleashed? 

The might of Bastian Klauswitz was unmatched, his strategies unparalleled, and his cunning incomparable. 

Yet, what if those same qualities led him down a path of destruction?

For now, however, the Berg army's hold over the North Sea had only grown stronger, and the defeat at Trosa had dealt a critical blow to Lovita's navy. There was no denying that Captain Klauswitz was deserving of the title of hero, his deeds already etched in history books. Yet, the Emperor couldn't help but wonder, what if the future held something far more sinister for this formidable warrior?

As the emperor gazed out the window, his mind weighed heavily on the formidable presence of Bastian Klauswitz, like a fierce dog that could turn and bite at any moment. The more he learned of Bastian's unyielding spirit, the deeper his apprehension grew.

Bastian was a force to be reckoned with, unyielding in his refusal to bow to authority, but also cunning enough to manipulate it to his advantage. The emperor couldn't help but wonder what kind of leash would be strong enough to tame such a beast.

With a worried sigh, the emperor rose from his seat and approached the window, peering out at the lush gardens and the tranquil Prater River beyond. Though he could sense Bastian's silent presence behind him, he refused to turn and face him.

"The stain on the honor of my daughter and the imperial family is not a mere trifle, but a weighty matter that carries the weight of the entire empire," the emperor spoke with a regal bearing, his voice echoing in the grand hall. The warmth of a loving father was now replaced by the solemnity of a ruler, and Bastian felt the weight of his words as he lowered his head in understanding. 

The emperor's gaze was firm, a reflection of the unyielding spirit that governed the vast reaches of the empire.

The union of Princess Isabelle of Berg and Crown Prince Leo of Belov was a necessity. Bastian, a seasoned warrior who had faced the tumultuous tides of international politics, understood this better than anyone else. In order to counteract the ever-growing naval might of Lovita, a partnership with Belov was crucial. The sacred bond of matrimony between the princess and the prince was the cornerstone of this alliance, built to withstand the storms of time.

"Your Majesty, I share in your hope for a successful military alliance with Belov," Bastian spoke firmly. The emperor pivoted on his heels, hands clasped behind his back, his piercing gaze fixed upon Bastian.

 "Let me make this clear," he said, his tone brooking no argument. "Should Isabelle's feelings for you interfere with this crucial alliance, should they pose a threat to the security of the empire, I will not hesitate to hold you accountable. It matters not whether it is your fault or whether you bear any guilt. Simply put, your presence has already caused irreparable damage to the imperial family."

"I have made plans to return to the frontlines, Your Majesty," announced Bastian with determination. "While approval from superiors is expected to come later this fall, a simple command from Your Majesty to the Admiralty would see me setting sail tomorrow."

The emperor's piercing gaze hardened as he questioned, "Do you truly believe this situation can be remedied so easily?"



As the carriage approached the city limits, the number of passengers dwindled. Odette stood, clinging to a pillar by the door, as the lights of the sprawling metropolis flickered over her blank expression. 

The seats around her were largely unoccupied, yet one person was notably absent - Bastian Klauswitz. The captain was still with his beloved, far from the lonely carriage and the night-shrouded city.

However, Odette, unable to depart, implored for a mere answer to the mystery of whether her father had ever graced the halls of the mansion. The kind-hearted old butler, taking pity on her, granted her request. Her father was nowhere to be seen today. Although the news provided her with a sliver of relief, it was quickly shattered when she learned that her father had once encountered Bastian Klauswitz without prior notice. Her heart plummeted at the unexpected revelation.

Odette was happy that she had avoided encountering the man. She wouldn't have been able to handle it if she had actually met Bastian.

She left a message in hopes that he would respond shortly. No, it was okay if she went unnoticed indefinitely. That was something she had kind of hoped for.

As the carriage approached the final stop, Odette gathered all her courage and stepped out. She nervously smoothed out her dress, which she had fidgeted with several times during the ride, and brushed her hair back, trying to rid herself of any signs of distress. 

The effort was in vain, as the creases in her heart could not be erased so easily. But she knew that if she at least put on a brave face, she might be able to carry the burden of this life with a little more grace.

With the pieces slowly falling into place, Odette realized the reason for the man's sudden mention of her father. She had long since been acquainted with her father's tempestuous ways, but the man's faith in a future promise left her grappling with confusion.

 Why had he placed so much trust in an uncertain future?

The enigma that eluded a solution only served to plunge Odette deeper into despair. Regrettably, she realized she should have been forthright from the start.

Odette was done with the charade, done with the thought of ever laying eyes on him again.

“Not this again! I can’t take it anymore!” 

With a heavy heart, Odette trudged down the moonlit avenue and entered the townhouse, only to be greeted by a loud, annoyed voice. It was none other than the spouse of the building superintendent.

"For heaven's sake, go up to your unit and do something about the racket!" The building manager's wife let out a groan, her frustration palpable.

"What's going on?" Odette replied, taken aback.

"Oh no, they fight again!" Mrs. Palmer exclaimed, her eyes growing wide with frustration. However, Odette could no longer listen to her litany of complaints. She had to take swift action and put an end to the scuffle between her father and Tira. It was time to tidy up the chaos.

With determined steps, Odette raced up the staircase, ready to intervene and restore peace to the household.

She was all too familiar with this scene, one that had played out time and time again, yet her feet refused to budge. A fierce yearning to flee took hold of her, to spin on her heels and escape into the welcoming embrace of the night streets. To leave behind the familiar turmoil, to forget her father and Tira, and to cast off the chains of her societal standing that weighed her down. To wander far, far away, free at last.

"I apologize, ma'am. I humbly request your patience," Odette said, with her head hung low, taking the place of her father and Tira in offering contrition.

Mrs. Palmer, who had unleashed a barrage of complaints upon her, stalked away with discontent written all over her face, her steps echoing her dissatisfaction. With a heavy sigh, Odette quickly scampered up the staircase.

"No way, Let go!" 

Tira shrieked, just as Odette arrived at the top floor landing. The force of Tira's scream was so intense that it took Odette's breath away. In the next moment, her father burst through the front door, with Tira clinging to him for dear life. 

"Let go!" Tira implored.

"My money! Give it back to me! It belongs to me!" Duke Dyssen demanded with a roar.

The argument between Duke and Tira over the box filled with their emergency funds escalated into a full-blown fight.

"Father!" Tira cried out, using all her might to push him away as he lifted his hand to strike.

With a harrowing howl, Duke Dyssen stumbled and tumbled down the steps, his fall a blur of motion. In the next moment, he lay motionless, his form twisted and contorted. 

Rushing to her father's side, Odette crumpled to the ground, unable to utter a sound. The dark red blood, pulsing and alive, spread across the wooden floorboards and stained the hem of her skirt. Tira , trembling out of fear, let out a fierce, guttural cry, shaking the very foundations of the aging building.

Chapter 27.

Hero's Last Option.





The Emperor's words hung heavy in the air, a threat veiled in casual amusement. "Surviving the night is not a guarantee," he said, his tone almost playful. "Heroes can easily end up as refuse in the alleyways, but that's just the way of power. Unfair, yes, but what can one do?" 

Bastian saw through the smile and knew the danger that lurked beneath. The tranquil existence before the Emperor's gaze was no facade. 

"I could be merciful," he mused, "and acknowledge your past accomplishments. But perhaps a compromise is in order, to quell that smug expression mocking the imperial family and our society. What say you?" The Emperor regarded Bastian like a surgeon preparing to operate, his intentions clear.

"If the notion doesn't suit you," the Emperor murmured, turning to open the window. The breeze from the Prater River garden wafted in, rich with the fragrance of roses and dampness. "I suppose there is but one remaining option for our hero...."

Bastian awaited with patience the words that would bring about humility. This was indeed the Emperor's command. The one phrase that would determine his future was to be that one.

The Emperor's eyes fluttered open, his voice firm as he issued his edict: "You are to marry without delay." Bastian, whose unwavering gaze had always betrayed his confidence, felt his eyes falter for the first time, unsettled by the suddenness of the Emperor's command.

"I have set my sights on Odette to be your wife," the Emperor began, his voice certain. "But should you be unable to secure the daughter of Duke Dyssen, you may select a bride from your inventory. And if, by chance, you were to elope with Count Lenard's wife, Sandrine,I would not fault you for it." 

Emperor waved his hand dismissively, "Regardless of the bride you choose, you must be wed before the summer festival begins. For two years, you must remain married to ensure that Isabelle remains wed to Belov until the birth of their first child. After that, I will not interfere. Though it is my sincerest wish that your family be happy, if that is not the case, divorce is an option."

"Your Majesty, the day you mentioned is coming up in just under two months” Bastain said

"As time will be scarce, but preferable to meeting a gruesome fate or enduring facial mutilation, wouldn't it be the wiser choice?" quipped the Emperor, leaving Bastian with a sense of detachment as he gracefully pivoted away from the window.

"Join in matrimony, and let the world behold an impeccable duo. This way, should the Crown Prince of Belov learn of your liaison with Isabelle, he shall not perceive it as a threat but merely a trifle? And in return, I shall reward you handsomely," proposed the Emperor, exuding an air of astute bargaining as he settled into the plush couch.

"Why do you bear such a countenance? Did you not pledge to heed my every decree? Dare you deceive the throne?" interrogated the Emperor, his eyes ablaze with intensity.

"Never, Your Majesty. However, this matter..." replied Bastian, his voice trailing off as he grappled with the weight of his response.

"As pledged, I shall grant your wishes following two years of wedlock. Be it a noble designation or any other indulgences that align with the Empire's tenets and regulations, they shall be yours. This vow is made in the emperor's name and honor, and I shall uphold it," promised the Emperor, as the breeze carried the fragrance of roses. Meanwhile, Bastian gazed towards the Emperor, with his back braced against the gusts of wind.

“This is my command. It’s time to reveal Bastian Klauswitz's truth, to learn who Bastian actually is.” Emperor growled.



As Bastian stepped out of the emperor's private residence, a soft light illuminated the sky, casting a blue hue over everything. He stopped in his tracks, taking a moment to gaze up at the tranquil dawn sky. It was as if time had paused, and the world was holding its breath.

But the peaceful moment didn't last. Bastian felt like he was in a surreal dream, one that he couldn't quite grasp. He recognized the familiar sight of his bed and ceiling, but something was different. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew that today would be unlike any other day.

With a snide remark and a determined expression, Bastian set off towards the back gate of the imperial palace. The fragrance of roses mingled with the mist rising from the nearby Prater River, enveloping him in a heady aroma. It was a fitting metaphor for his current state - his role was as thick and heavy as the scent of the flowers.

As he walked, his mind raced with questions and uncertainties. What did the emperor want from him? What was expected of him now? Only time would tell, but Bastian was ready to face whatever lay ahead.

"Master, are you well?" Hans, an attendant who had been loitering by the fence near the parked car, rushed over as Bastian emerged from the back door.

Bastian ran his fingers through his tousled hair and took charge, putting on a smile without much fuss. Hans scurried after him and opened the back seat door, allowing Bastian to slip off his jacket and sink deep into the plush leather seat.

As the weariness that he had forgotten washed over him, Bastian shut his eyes and let out a bitter laugh. The demands of his role had taken their toll, and even though he had put on a brave face in front of Hans, he was struggling to keep up. It was a reminder that he was only human, and even the strongest of men had their breaking point.

"Please don't worry, it's nothing. Let's proceed," Bastian said with a weary voice, as he flung his tie over his jacket. In no time, the engine roared to life, and the car set off.

As the vehicle made its way down the street, Bastian dozed off, lost in thought. It was only when the car passed by the Reinfeld Hotel, on a Wednesday when the flowers were in full bloom, that he stirred from his slumber. This was the place where the emperor had introduced him to the woman who was to be his companion.

He gazed out of the window, his mind racing as he considered the dilemma before him. The woman presented to him by the emperor was undoubtedly the most suitable option, but was she the right choice for him? He wiped his face slowly, lost in thought as he mulled over the same question that had plagued the emperor. It was a difficult decision, one that would have far-reaching consequences.

The emperor's fury was entirely justified, and so was the decree that followed. Despite his initial misgivings, he  understood and respected the emperor's decision as the ruler of the empire. If he could secure the gains he sought by sacrificing two years of his life, then he was prepared to make the deal.

Although there were obstacles to be overcome, such as the complications arising from the involvement of the Laviere family, two years was a necessary period of time for Sandrine's divorce proceedings to conclude and for her to find a suitable partner.

For now, the most rational course of action was to take advantage of the interim period to make a substantial profit, and then proceed with the marriage to Sandrine, sharing each other's divorce experiences on equal footing.

However, Odette was the bigger problem, and it was a significant one that left Bastian feeling hesitant.

 In truth, she was the best candidate for the task at hand, and this only added to his consternation.

Bastian loathed the idea of preying on a woman who had been cast aside by the world. The prospect of spending two years in her company filled him with an overwhelming sense of discomfort. Yet, in a society where fathers were willing to trade their daughters for a handful of coins, it was evident that there were no perfect choices. After all, whoever he chose wouldn't surely be a better option than Duke Dyssen, the reprehensible nobleman who had tormented the kingdom for years.

As Bastian mulled over the multitude of possible scenarios, the car turned onto a street that led straight to the townhouse. The first light of dawn had just begun to creep over the horizon, but the breeze wafting through the open car window carried with it a gentle warmth, as if a whisper from the coming summer in Berg.



Lovis was pacing back and forth in front of the mansion, his eyes wide with anxiety as he waited for Bastian's arrival. As soon as he saw his master, he rushed over and posed the same question in a worried tone,

 "Are you all right?"

 It was clear that Lovis had been up all night, and the lack of sleep had taken a toll on him.

With anxiety written across his face, Lovis asked him, "I'll make sure to get in touch with Admiral Demel for you." Take the day off and relax; you appear to be in need of it.”

"That won't be necessary." Bastian calmly waived him off before advancing inside the entryway of the mansion, tinge of fatigue in his voice, "Just give me a few minutes to rest my eyes. Let's forego breakfast today and get some hot coffee ready in an hour or so. That will be adequate."

As Bastian made his way across the hall, he could sense the unease radiating from the old butler. But just as he took his first step on the staircase, Lovis stopped him with a surprising revelation.

"There was a visitor last night," Lovis said, his voice hushed.

"A visitor?" Bastian turned to face him, his curiosity piqued. Lovis reached into his pocket and handed over a visiting card and a note.

His eyes widened as he read the name on the card. 

Odette Theresia Marie-Lore Charlotte von Dyssen.

Bastian's gaze drifted from the visiting card to the note, his brow furrowing in thought at the lengthy name inscribed upon it. He barely registered Lovis approaching and speaking, relaying his response to the unexpected visitor from the previous night.

“I carried out your instructions, master.” With a deep bow, Lovis affirmed.

As Lovis spoke, Bastian's mind was already racing with possibilities and potential consequences of this encounter. Suddenly, a memory resurfaced, and he nodded in affirmation, recalling the strict orders he had given Lovis before he had entered the palace. ~ Be silent about tonight's affairs.

“Lady Odette stated that she had a personal query, so I responded.”  Lovis said.

Bastian unfolded the note under the visiting card and looked up at Lovis, his curiosity piqued. "And what did Lady Odette ask?" 

Lovis approached Bastian with an anxious expression, "My lord, Lady Odette paid a visit last night and asked if the Duke had been here yesterday. I informed her that while he had come uninvited once before, he had not been here yesterday."

“I see.” Bastian released a brief exhale, a hint of amusement tingeing the sound.

I humbly ask for your forgiveness as I now bear the burden of my father's misdeeds. I promise to do everything in my power to atone and make sure you never experience any trouble at his hands again. Please accept my apologies.

Odette's careful handwriting was a stark contrast to the crooked lines that appeared to be written hastily. Lovis noticed the difference and couldn't help but speak up. "If I have made any mistakes..."

“No. please relax."  Bastian walked briskly up the stairs and into the bedroom while shaking his head slightly.

Bastian threw the visitor's card and note on the table before first going to the restroom. When he exited the shower, the sunlight filled the entire bedroom.

As the warm breeze flowed through the open windows, Bastian lounged in his loose gown, contemplating the events that were to unfold. The cigar box on the table beckoned to him, and with a sigh, he reached for it. The summer solstice had arrived, marking the beginning of the season's festivities throughout Berg.

Bastian knew that on the day set by the emperor, he would be wed. It was a fact that he had come to accept, but not without a tinge of bitterness. He cut off the tip of his cigar, accepting the inevitable fate that awaited him.

Two years later, the marriage that he had entered into would crumble and fall, much like the ashes of his cigar. 

And so, Mrs. Klauswitz,~the one who will provide him with the companionship he needed in those timeframe, would quietly waiting in the background like the plants in his garden. And when the time came, she would vanish with a large sum of money, just as quickly as she had arrived.

Bastian leaned back in his chair, staring off into the distance as he contemplated the situation at hand. He knew that finding a bride was not going to be difficult - there were plenty of women who were willing to agree to the conditions and pay. 

Just Odette.

Just thinking of Odette made him feel something that he couldn't quite put his finger on. 

As he retraced his steps back to the starting point, the unwelcome face of reality scratched at his nerves like a sharp blade. The clock was ticking, and he had less than two months to find a bride. He couldn't afford to waste any more time.

Bastian took a deep breath and steadied himself. He knew what he had to do. To hold a wedding ceremony with minimal formality, he had to choose a bride within three days at the latest. And he was determined to make it happen.

He sat in his leather armchair, a lit cigar dangling from his lips as he read Odette's note for what seemed like the hundredth time. He couldn't quite understand why she had bothered to apologize in person. It seemed like a pointless gesture to him.

Duke Dyssen was a person who would remain that way for his entire life, and that was beyond of the woman's purview. It would have been better in that situation to blatantly walk away. Much preferable to leaving unfulfilled promises.

As he crushed the note in his hand, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of bitterness. Why did Odette have to come into his life, only to make him feel this way? He tried to erase the memories of both father and daughter, much like a dirty stain that he could scrub away with enough effort.

With a sigh, he brought the cigar back to his lips, the smoke swirling around him like a protective shield. His cheeks began to pink as he inhaled deeply, and the smoke he exhaled dispersed like a thought.



Bastian sat at the long dining table, lost in thought as he toyed with his food. It was towards the end of lunch when he finally remembered her name - Lady Odette. The worst and the best thing to ever happen to him.

Just as he was about to delve deeper into his thoughts, a sharp voice cut through the silence. "I have an urgent letter for you, Captain," the officer announced, handing him a sealed envelope.

Bastian had dozed off on the narrow cot in the break room, but was abruptly woken by the call of a duty officer who had come on an errand. The officer handed over a letter from Lovis, which Bastian assumed was a response to his instructions to bring Lady Odette to the mansion.

After the officer politely saluted and left, Bastian eagerly tore open the roughly torn envelope to read the contents of the letter. To his surprise, it was not about the appointment time but contained news that was as sudden and jolting as a royal decree. Lovis had clearly put in great effort to convey the unexpected message.

Lady Odette is unable to accept the invitation to visit the mansion to discuss the wedding because of her current circumstances. I've learned that Duke Dyssen fell down the stairs last night and shattered his spine and cracked his head as well as other critical injuries. He is being treated at Ratz Municipal Hospital while unconscious. Even if he is fortunate enough to awaken, the general consensus is that he will be forced to spend the rest of his life as a paraplegic.

Bastian's eyes scanned the note once more, his mind racing with the weight of the news it contained. With a deep sigh, he crumpled the paper and stuffed it into the pocket of his uniform.

Lying back down on the narrow cot, Bastian closed his eyes, his body weary from the trials of the day. The weight of his responsibilities felt heavier than ever, and he wondered how he would manage to navigate the unexpected turns fate had dealt him. As he drifted off to sleep, Bastian knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but for now, he allowed himself a moment of relief.

Chapter 28.

Frail Bubble.



'If only he hadn't woken up'

Countess Trier heaved a sigh. The anguished wails, almost resembling screams, had been echoing from behind the closed hospital door for what felt like an eternity. 

The heart-wrenching sound carried a weight of despair and seemed to seep into every inch of the sterile hallway, a haunting reminder of the suffering that lay behind the barrier.

"I'm sorry, Countess," With a deep sense of empathy, Odette turned towards the Countess and uttered her apologies. "My father is deeply agitated at the moment, and I fear that it may not be the best time for you to visit him." Despite the overwhelming weight of the situation, Odette carried herself with grace and poise. Her unwavering composure, a testament to her inner strength, seemed to radiate a sense of serenity amidst the chaos that surrounded them.

The Countess Trier's compassionate touch conveyed a silent understanding that transcended words. "There is no need for that," she said softly, offering a sense of solace to Odette. "I've heard that he may never walk again, so it's alright."

In that moment, the frenzied screams that had been reverberating through the hospital corridors faded into an eerie silence, as if the doctors had taken swift action to calm the tumultuous situation. Despite the gravity of the circumstance, the Countess's soothing presence seemed to fill the air with a sense of tranquility, a balm for the aching souls that surrounded her.

The once-still form of Duke Dyssen stirred, his eyelids flickering open to reveal a dazed gaze. The Countess realized it was wrong to wish for anyone's death. But as her attention shifted to the prospect of what lay ahead, a sense of melancholy crept over her. 

The thought of Odette's uncertain future weighed heavily on her heart, the burden of a life spent caring for her father now a very real possibility.

The Countess couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow for her shattered hope - the prospect of marrying Bastian Klauswitz. 

Who in their right mind would want to wed a lady doomed to a lifetime of unending misery?

“Worry not about the hospital bill," Countess Trier's voice carried a reassuring tone as she made her pledge to the beleaguered family. "I will personally inform the imperial family and, if need be, I will implore the country to step in and assist."

“Thank you, Countess.” Odette's words were almost a whisper as she made her plea to the Countess. Her voice quivered slightly, betraying the depth of her shame. "I'm sorry to ask…." she began, her gaze fixed firmly on the ground. "But please, can you ask His Majesty to understand my situation regarding the marriage proposal? And also, the pension...it would mean the world to us." 

"My dear Odette," Countess Trier murmured softly, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. As she gazed upon the young woman before her, her heart ached with a deep and abiding sorrow. Odette's lips trembled, a silent testament to the pain that lay beneath the surface. The room was suffused with a sense of helplessness, a feeling that seemed to permeate the very air they breathed.

Even in the depths of despair, Odette's thoughts turned to the small pension that was her only lifeline. Countess Trier watched as the young woman's face crumpled in pain, the weight of her troubles threatening to overwhelm her. 

The memory of how she had once used that same pension as a bargaining chip to secure her agreement to the marriage proposal hung heavily in the Countess's mind, a bitter reminder of the cruelty and selfishness of her past actions.

Fumbling for words of comfort, the Countess could find no solace in her own thoughts. Instead, she reached out and gently stroked Odette's cheek, a gesture of silent support and understanding.  Before a slender figure darted down the dimly-lit hospital corridor, her breaths coming in ragged gasps as she cried out a single word,

"Sister!" 

Countess Trier watched in surprise as Tira approached, her heart racing with a mix of apprehension and curiosity.

"I'm sorry, Countess," Odette said, turning to the older woman with a small frown. "Could you please wait a moment?" With a quick nod, she released the hem of her skirt, which she had been twisting nervously in her hands, and hurried off to meet the newcomer.

The weight of the world seemed to be resting on the thin shoulders of the child before her, and it wasn't just the burden of her ugly, crippled father.

 Countess Trier felt her own heart constrict with a mix of sympathy and despair, as she gazed upon the girl's fragile form and the weight of her troubles. Her own breath caught in her throat, but she managed to give the child a small nod of encouragement. 

"Yes," she said softly, "don't worry and go." With those words, she watched as the girl turned and hurried down the hallway, disappearing around the corner and out of sight.



Tira's small voice quivered with fear and uncertainty, as tears still streamed down her face. Odette knew that the situation was dire and needed to act quickly. She quickly scanned the surroundings, looking for a place where they could speak without being overheard.

Finally, she spotted a secluded corner in the hospital's backyard and motioned for Tira to follow her.

"Sister, am I going to jail now? Huh?” Tira spoke after wailing for a lengthy period of time.

Odette's eyes darted around nervously as she spoke in hushed tones, her words barely audible above the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze. Tira's tear-streaked face looked up at her sister, hopeful yet uncertain.

"Father doesn't recall it." Odette said, her tone firm and unwavering.

Tira nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of the situation. As they huddled together in the shadows, the distant hum of hospital activity providing a distant background, Odette continued in a firm voice "I believe his memory is hazy because he was intoxicated. He thought he stumbled and fell. It is the truth if that is what he thinks.”

"Oh, sister..." 

"Don't dwell on it. It was an unfortunate incident that was out of our control," consoled Odette. 

Tira's guilt consumed her as she confessed, "But I was the one who pushed father with my own hands…."

"Quiet, Tira."  Odette snapped at her.

"I'm absolutely terrified.” Tira's body shook uncontrollably as she expressed her terror, “what if someone in the building witnessed what happened, even if father doesn't recall it?" 

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Tira's anxiety only escalated as she speculated, "It must have been the case. The manager's wife despises me so much. She could have been observing me on that day. She saw everything! I believe she was lurking behind me sister, concealing herself behind the stair railing."

"Tira, please." Odette pleaded desperately. 

"I cannot bear this anymore. I am going to the police station right away. Perhaps, if I surrender and confess, the punishment will be less severe. I am utterly petrified, and I feel like I'm descending into hell. I'll have to tell father everything, sister..."

Slap!

Tira's frenzied behavior was abruptly halted by a forceful smack across her cheek, causing her to reel from the impact.

"Pull yourself together, Tira.” Odette's voice rang out, commanding her attention, as she grasped Tira's shoulders with an unwavering grip. Despite being terrified and on the verge of tears, Tira strained to listen closely. “What you did was justified self-defense. Regardless of what anyone else may say, that remains an undeniable fact."

"Sister..." Tira called out to her sister with a plaintive cry.

"I may not be a religious person, but even if a higher power exists, they would not condemn you to eternal damnation for this. If someone has to suffer the consequences, I'll be the one to do so. Do you comprehend what I'm saying?" Surveying their surroundings one last time, Odette fixed her gaze on Tira, "I don't want you to carry the burden of something that is now beyond our control. I do not want to see you unhappy."

Odette's touch was gentle as she wiped away Tira's tears, unlike the roughness of the slap that had struck her moments ago.  "Promise me that you will keep this a secret. Do it for me, please." Her voice was soft and pleading as she made her request.

"Yes..." Tira's response was barely audible, a soft moan-like sound escaping her lips as she acquiesced. She was consumed with remorse and could barely choke out the words, "I'm so sorry, sister."

Tira's anguished expression contorted with pain as she clung to Odette, seeking comfort and solace in her sister's embrace. With eyes tightly shut, Odette enveloped the trembling child in her arms, offering a sense of protection and stability.

Tira's tears flowed relentlessly, drenching Odette's blouse as she wept uncontrollably. As the cries began to fade, the rustling of the leaves punctuated the stillness that descended upon them.

Odette held Tira for what felt like an eternity, her own fear and anxiety bubbling beneath the surface, but she was determined not to reveal it. For Odette, love was a responsibility, and her faith gave her the strength to bear it.

As Tira's sobs eventually subsided, Odette regained her composure and wiped away the traces of tears on her little sister's face with her sleeve. Straightening Tira's tousled hair and fixing her crooked collar, she exhaled a deep breath and gathered her resolve, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

“Let’s head back.” Odette grasped Tira's hand, her fingers intertwined with her little sister's, and led her away from the backyard. As they made their way through the hospital corridors, the sounds of their footsteps echoed off the walls, reverberating through the emptiness around them.

With each step they took, Tira's sobs gradually tapered off, until even the faintest sound of a sniffle had ceased by the time they reached the second floor where their father's room was located. The silence was deafening, and Odette's grip on Tira's hand

Countess Trier sat on a chair in the hallway, waiting for the two sisters to return from their discussion. As soon as she saw them, she stood up and approached them with a purposeful stride.

“Did the conversation go well?”  She inquired, her sharp gaze fixed on Odette and Tira.

Before Odette could respond, she was interrupted by the Countess's stern voice. "If you say sorry one more time, I will get angry." The old lady's firm tone left no room for argument, and Odette quickly suppressed the urge to apologize once more.

"The physician foretold that it shall take a span of three to four hours more for your father to regain consciousness from the sedative. However, worry not, for I will designate a vigilant sentinel to keep watch over his ailing frame. As for you, my dear Odette, it appears that you have been tending to your father without rest for several sunsets. I implore you to retire to your quarters and allow your weary mind and body to mend. Only then will you be equipped to persevere through this ordeal." Countess Trier implored

"Your concern is much appreciated, dear Countess, but rest assured that I am in good spirits," Odette replied.

"Pardon me for contradicting, but you seem to be far from fine," remarked the Countess

"May I be so bold as to make a humble request? If it's not too much trouble, would you be willing to take Tira instead of me?" inquired Odette after pondering for a moment, making her plea with prudence and care.

It was only upon closer inspection that Countess Trier became aware of the disheveled young girl concealed behind her sister's back. Tira, the half-sister of Odette, gazed upon the Countess with timidity, lowering her head and greeting her in a meek and subdued tone. Despite her untidy appearance, Tira exuded an aura of humility, far from resembling a pampered child.

"I fear it would be challenging to leave Tira behind, as she is still in a state of shock, and there's no one at home to attend to her," remarked Odette, expressing her concerns about leaving the child behind.

"Very well, then. Let us proceed with your proposal. I will take the child under my wing," Countess Trier assented hastily, her heart touched by Odette's affectionate treatment of her half-sister, despite the scant age difference between them. The Countess could perceive the hardships that Odette had endured in her past, and it softened the heart of the normally stern and austere old lady.

"Rather than persisting with such folly and obstinacy, I implore you to come to my residence and rest for the night. A true lady should know when to relinquish the facade of strength during challenging times," urged the Countess, urging Odette to set aside her pride and prioritize her well-being.

"Indeed, Countess. Your counsel is wise," replied Odette with a weak smile and a wan complexion, nodding her head in agreement. Though hesitant, she mustered the courage to express her gratitude, uttering the words, "Thank you, Countess."

 As she spoke, a sense of apprehension colored her voice, and the Countess could not help but notice the young lady's frailty. Countess Trier's aged lips curved into a gentle arc as she gazed blankly at Odette, pondering the young lady's countenance. 

In that moment, the Countess could not help but observe that the abandoned princess's daughter was far more deserving of the title "princess" than her own mother.

She was very saddened by the realization.



The sun shone bright in the sky, casting a warm glow across the hospital courtyard. It was a serene spring afternoon, and Odette sat on a verdant bench with peeling paint in certain spots, gazing wistfully at the lush flower beds before her. 

As she looked on, the vibrant blooms seemed to sway in the gentle breeze, their colorful petals resembling the flowing dresses of graceful dancers. The air was thick with the heady fragrance of roses and honeysuckle, enveloping her in a sweet embrace. It was a time when everything turned to gold, and yet Odette remained a solitary figure, estranged from the beauty of the spring festival.

The world was an indifferent place, showing no regard for the mere mortals that roamed its surface. 

This was a truth that Odette had come to accept, much like how the passage of time brought about the blooming and withering of flowers, the shifting of seasons, and the capriciousness of the weather. In this ruthless and unyielding order, there was little room for an individual's joys or sorrows.

 It simply was what it was.

Even if rain had fallen on this day, it would have made no difference to Odette's mood. The only change would have been the catalyst for her sense of isolation, which had now evolved into a feeling of monotony, a sense of being trapped in an unchanging pattern.

She was intimately familiar with the feeling of hopelessness and despair. It was a constant companion that trailed behind her like a shadow, always lurking around the corner. She knew that the world was indifferent to the struggles of ordinary people like herself, and that life was often cruel and unfair.

Yet even with this knowledge, there were moments when Odette couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by her own weakness. Today was one of those times.

 The world around her was too beautiful, too perfect, and too heartbreaking. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the flowers were in bloom, but none of it brought her any joy.

Sitting on the weathered bench, Odette stared out at the idyllic scene with the expression of a lost child. Her once-neatly braided hair had come undone, but she didn't bother to fix it. What did it matter, when everything else in her life was falling apart?

Odette paid no attention to her crumpled clothes and dusty shoes, nor did she care about her disheveled hair. Even her mother, who was obsessed with maintaining appearances, couldn't have found fault with Odette's current state.

Meanwhile, Tira had been taken to Countess Trier's house while their father was passed out from sedatives. It brought a temporary sense of peace, but Odette knew it wouldn't last long. A fierce wave of turmoil would soon consume her once again.

As she sat on the bench, feeling as fragile as a bubble that could burst and disappear at any moment, the sound of approaching footsteps caught her attention. The footsteps grew louder until they came to a halt at the edge of the bench where Odette sat, her head down.

When she looked up, the first thing that caught her eye was a long shadow cast over her feet.

The glaring brightness of the white shoes pierced through Odette's eyes, a familiar sensation that triggered a sense of foreboding. 

Slowly, her gaze climbed up the long legs, wrapped in pants of the same color as the shoes, until a white jacket emerged. It was followed by a more dazzling display of light: a golden belt, splendid medals and insignia, shoulder straps and epaulettes made of gold thread.

 As soon as Odette recognized the decorations that symbolized soldiers’ honor, her gaze reached the face of the man standing before her.

Bastian Klauswitz. 

He towered over her, his vivid blue eyes shining in the bright sunlight. Slowly, he took off his hat, revealing his tousled blonde hair, and looked down at the stunned Odette.

As if a spell had been broken, the sound of Bastian's voice snapped Odette out of her daze. His words were a sharp reminder of the harsh reality she was facing. Slowly, she lifted her head to face him and offered a silent bow, a gesture of gratitude and respect. In response, Bastian inclined his head in a show of acknowledgement and sympathy.

"I was told about the accident," he said, his voice low and somber. “I feel bad for the duke's poor fortune.”

Bastian's words cut through the air with an urgent tone, demanding Odette's attention. "Lady Odette, I must speak with you. It's a matter of great importance." His words left no room for argument or hesitation.


Chapter 29.

A Stain Beside Him.



As Bastian wrapped up his introduction, he presented a folder and urged the recipient to peruse its contents. "Here is a document that captures the core of our conversation. I beg you to carefully review it and offer your comments." He stated and handed the paper across.

Within the pages lay a succinct agreement encapsulating all the important points he had just discussed. With ease, Bastian had conveyed the complexities of safeguarding the demanding princess, having been intimately acquainted with the challenges himself.

The mandate from the emperor was clear - a matrimonial bond must be forged, and a two-year commitment was required. Rest assured, ample compensation would be provided for the chosen one. And as I pondered over the ideal candidate, my thoughts settled upon you, for it seems that you possess all the qualities required for the task at hand. Should you choose to accept, the ceremony shall be formalized at the end of the upcoming month.

At its core, the matter was uncomplicated, and the average person would have grasped it with ease - a fact not lost on Bastian, who perceived the woman to possess sufficient acumen. 

Unfortunately, what she lacked was the fortitude to act upon the information imparted to her. 

"I am willing to explain further, should the need arise," Bastian offered.

The tense hush was broken by Bastian's measured tone, and after a protracted spell of staring blankly at the folder, Odette lifted her head. Though her apparent indecision was testing Bastian's patience, he proceeded with a composed demeanor, mindful of her predicament and the challenges she faced.

With a lull in the conversation, Odette posed a query to Bastian, "So, is it safe to assume that you intend to propose to me?" 

As the initial shock subsided, Odette blinked her dazed eyes, seeking to make sense of the situation at hand. After a brief pause, she finally found her voice.

 "If I may interject, I believe the term 'contract' would be more fitting in this instance. Essentially, what I am proposing is gainful employment," Bastian explained, clarifying the nature of the arrangement.

"Is this a novel form of philanthropy you are practicing, captain?" Odette responded with a sardonic chuckle, as she processed the unusual circumstances - a chance encounter with a stranger who appeared out of the blue at the hospital where her ailing father was being treated, offering her employment. 

Despite her reservations, she remained rooted to the spot, lacking the fortitude to walk away from this crazy man with such an intriguing proposition.

As the initial sense of disorientation faded away, Odette finally focused her gaze upon the man standing before her. It was none other than Bastian Klauswitz, who was now broaching the subject of purchasing a bride with his vast wealth - a sham of a wife, meant to serve as nothing more than a disposable bargaining chip in a deal with the emperor, lasting a mere two years. 

The giddiness intensified, causing Odette to falter and seek refuge on the nearby bench, as she struggled to catch her breath. 

In a moment of concern, Bastian approached her. Once more, he offered the documents, this time with a more resolute air. "I realize that this is a trying time for you, but I implore you to approach this matter with an open mind," he advised, urging Odette to consider his proposition.

"Are you suggesting that you are doing me a favor?" Odette was quick to respond, her voice laced with skepticism, unconvinced by his appeal.

Bastian knelt and dropped the contract onto Odette's lap, "It is comforting to know that you possess a measure of logical reasoning." He maintained his detached demeanor as he provided a dispassionate account of the situation.  "The wedding has been scheduled by the Emperor and I have identified several prospective candidates. I intend to make a final selection by the end of today," he stated, his blue eyes remaining steadfast and unwavering. 

Despite her anger, Odette found herself unable to respond in kind in the face of his unyielding composure. Bastian spoke in a matter-of-fact tone, his words cutting through the air with precision. He seemed completely unaffected by Odette's presence or the absurdity of what he was proposing.

"Your looks and background make you the most suitable candidate for this arrangement. And, our previous acquaintance will make it easier to expedite the wedding. I was uncertain at first, but now I am confident that you are the best choice." 

Odette felt a knot form in her stomach as Bastian spoke. 

"If you're unsure...." she interrupted

"Putting Lady Odette first would have been challenging if not for your father's accident. It's safe to claim that the one decent thing Duke Dyssen did for his daughter was to break his back.” Bastian gazed steadily at Odette as he spoke his unvarnished truth. Despite her contemplative expression, he didn't hesitate to voice his thoughts. While Odette would undoubtedly excel in the role of a trophy wife, he was hesitant to deal with her father's potential troublemaking. It was a simple fact, and he had no qualms about stating it.

Had Duke Dyssen not been bedridden for the foreseeable future, Bastian wouldn't have bothered to visit this place with his proposition.

"In case you harbor illusions of marrying for love, feel free to decline. However, if that's not a concern for you, in my opinion, Lady Odette, this arrangement wouldn't be a bad deal," Bastian stated coolly, his attention momentarily drawn to his watch. He realized that he had already spent more time than intended on this matter and needed to focus on his top priority.

Bastian didn't beat around the bush and spoke plainly about the harsh reality of Odette's situation.

"Once your father is released from the hospital, you will be responsible for caring for him at home because your family's financial position prevents you from hiring nurses or servants. Furthermore, it's not like you have a close enough bond with your father to give up the rest of your life to care for his disability while relocating from one home to another. Am I misleading?”

Bastian's eyes flickered over to the document on Odette's lap, then back to her face. He was growing bored with this pointless back-and-forth, so he decided to cut to the chase. He wanted to make Odette understand the gravity of her situation, and he did so with ruthless efficiency. As he spoke, Odette's knuckles turned white from the intensity of her grip.

But Bastian noticed something else happening to Odette as well. Her body was trembling, and her face was contorting into a look of pure desperation. She looked like a fragile glass figurine, perched on the edge of a shelf, ready to shatter at the slightest touch.

Bastian knew what was coming next. If Odette refused his offer, she would be left with nothing. No money, no home, no future. She would be like a broken doll, discarded and forgotten.

But Odette surprised him. Despite the tears that shimmered in her eyes, she didn't cry. Instead, she looked up at him with a familiar strength. It was the same look she had given him on the night she was sold into a life of gambling and vice.

Bastian sent a look of courteous disinterest while patiently waiting. Odette's bloodless hands finally opened the papers just a short while afterwards.



Odette's heart sank as she finished reading the contract. This wasn't a marriage in any sense of the word. It was a business transaction, a deal, a cold arrangement between two strangers. 

They were to live together, but their relationship was to be devoid of any real intimacy. No shared bed, no touches, no love. It was a life of complete loneliness, with only the public facade of a happy couple to keep up. Two years of living like this would change them forever. As she closed the document, the true reason for Bastian's seeming generosity became clear.

Odette’s heart raced as she studied Bastian Klauswitz, his once pristine white uniform now stained with the fiery hues of the setting sun. The man beside her was no longer the charming businessman she had met before. Something about him had changed, and his mere presence now filled her with an icy dread.

Bastian sat with his legs crossed, staring off into the rose garden. Odette couldn't help but feel as though he was staring straight through her, his gaze piercing and unforgiving. Suddenly, she realized just how little she truly knew about this man.

It dawned on her that Bastian was a force to be reckoned with. He was willing to do whatever it took to get what he wanted, even if it meant risking his own life. He was unpredictable, uncontainable, and utterly beyond her control. Odette realized that the rumors circulating among high society about Bastian's power were not just hearsay – they were the truth.

As the last rays of sunlight dipped below the horizon, Odette couldn't shake the feeling of trepidation that had settled in her chest. This man, Bastian Klauswitz, was not to be trifled with.

The world was a well-ordered tree, towering over all who inhabited it. Many people struggled to survive, clinging to the branches, willing to be pruned by the forces that controlled their fate. But not Bastian Klauswitz. He was a wild and unyielding vine that refused to be tamed or trimmed. He had grown from the broken twigs and snaked around the trunk of the tree, his strength and tenacity threatening to strangle the very life out of it. Gardeners feared such plants, knowing they could take over and destroy the very foundation they depended on.

"Does the deal with His Majesty really warrant such a hefty cost?"

Odette's hushed voice delicately pierced the fragrant air. Bastian's head turned slowly, his emotionless smile silently affirming her assumption. 

"Once the two-year contract is up, Countess Lenart will most likely be the one to marry the Captain, isn't that right?" Odette asked. Her thoughts gradually sharpened, and with a clearer mind, she posed the question to Bastian, who gave an honest response without hesitation.

"Indeed, by then Sandrine would have settled her own marriage as well," Bastian replied with his characteristic honesty.

“Does the relationship between the Captain and Countess Lenart remain valid during the duration of our marriage contract? I mean…” Odette asked, her voice uncertain.

"In all situations when we identify as husband and wife, I will prioritise my wife's rights. But Sandrine de Laviere is much more significant to me in my personal life, and that won't change.” Bastian implored. He explained the situation clearly.

The day had finally arrived when Odette's fate would be sealed. She sat in front of the contract, her eyes scanning the fine print while her thoughts drifted away. She was well aware of the gravity of the situation, but it seemed like the roles had reversed. 

Her husband's mistress had become the new queen, and she, the once-revered wife, had been relegated to a mere pawn. However, Odette remained calm, fully aware of the farce that was their marriage. Everything was a lie, and there was no point in applying common sense to a relationship that was built on deceit and manipulation.

Odette's gaze lowered to the paper once again. As long as she signed it, her father could spend the rest of his life in a well-equipped convalescent hospital, and Tira, her half-sister, would receive a good education at a prestigious boarding school. It was an opportunity to break free from the shackles that had bound her for so long. The money that came with the deal would allow her to start anew, to build a life that was truly her own.

Odette hesitated for a moment, wondering if it was worth it. But deep down, she knew that it was foolish to pass on this chance.

Odette's hand hovered over the fountain pen, her eyes scanning the file folder. She knew that this decision would change the course of her life, but she couldn't make up her mind. It wasn't a matter of morality or honor; those notions had long since lost their hold on her. No, it was fear that gripped her, fear in its most visceral form.

"Just one day... I need time to consider…..," Odette requested, with trembling in her voice.

"As I said, I don't have much time." Bastian's response was curt. He stood up from the bench, cutting off any further discussion. "Are you refusing?"

Bastian glanced at his watch and asked.  His demeanor was chilly, and he seemed ready to move on to the next candidate if Odette so much as nodded. "If that's the case," he continued, "then I'll..."

"No!" With an impulsive burst of energy, Odette's response was resounding. She ardently shook her head, causing Bastian to take a step back as if to convey a willingness to grant a temporary suspension. The intensity of her refusal seemed to give Bastian pause, at least for the moment.

Odette's hand trembled as she gripped the fountain pen, unsure if she was making the right choice. The prospect of tomorrow was daunting, but the despair of today was suffocating. She knew that no matter what the next two years brought, it would be better than the reality she would face if she missed this opportunity. With that thought in mind, she made her decision.

She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, steadying herself as she straightened her grip on the fountain pen. The ink on the tip of the nib bled, creating a stain as it fell onto the signature line of the contract. But Odette didn't falter. For her, it was a small price to pay for a better ending than disappearing into nothingness.

As she finished signing her name, she felt a sense of resolve wash over her. She may have been scared, but she was determined to see this through. The ink on the contract may have stained her hands, but it couldn't stain her spirit.

Odette raised her head and examined Bastian's expression, hoping for a sign that he was pleased with her decision. But his face was as emotionless as ever, standing with his back to the sunlight. Uncertainty filled her, and her fingertips began to tremble. The exhaustion from the past three days, where she couldn't eat or sleep, washed over her all at once.

Despite her weakened state, Odette summoned all her strength and focused on writing her name next to his on the contract. With a final stroke, she released her grip, and the pen fell to the floor. She was barely conscious of Bastian as she did so.

But to her surprise, Bastian picked up the pen and retrieved the contract. After examining the signature line once more, he covered the folder, announcing the successful conclusion of the contract.

A tearful sigh erupted at that precise time. Odette hunched down and appeared to be about to pass out while exhaling heavily.

“Could you walk?”  

Bastian's question echoed in Odette's deaf ears. She was unable to respond verbally, but she managed a small nod of her head. Suddenly, she felt weightless and realized that she was being lifted into the air. In a moment of surprise, she opened her eyes to find herself cradled in his arms.

Bastian cast a quick glance at Odette before striding purposefully towards the hospital. Uncertain and overwhelmed, Odette buried her face in his shoulder, not sure what to do next. She was physically and emotionally drained, her body on the verge of collapse. It was unlikely that she could push away the large, solid man carrying her in such a weakened state.

"You look weak. We will go to Dr. Kramer's office," Bastian said calmly, his voice penetrating Odette's fading consciousness.

"But that doctor only treats special patients..." Odette's objection was cut off by Bastian without hesitation.

"You're Bastian Klauswitz's fiancée," he said firmly, resuming his steps towards the hospital. Odette's eyes fluttered closed, the warmth of Bastian's body and the clean scent of sunlight surrounding her.

The marriage contract became binding right away. There didn't seem to be any turning back.


Chapter 30.


The Most Exquisite and Gorgeous.



“I must admit that the haste with which I prepared for the wedding is unmatched in all my years on earth.” Countess Trier expressed her amusement with a laugh and a shake of her head.

Her day began with a visit to the jeweler, in search of the perfect gift, and continued with a stop to inspect the finished wedding dress. Next on her agenda was a meeting with Mrs. Gross, the chief planner for the groom's side, to finalize some of the wedding details scheduled for the upcoming weekend. For the past month, every day had been a battle, filled with similarly grueling tasks.

Amidst the clatter of carriage wheels and horseshoes, a smile lit up the Countess's face as she heard the words, "Thank you, Countess".

As Countess Trier gazed at the seat across from her, she was struck with wonder. There sat Odette, dressed in a lavender muslin gown, her smile as radiant as a sun-kissed summer day. The dazzling jewels adorning her person, bedecked with diamonds and pearls, lent an aura of sophistication to her already stunning appearance. In a mere month, Odette had undergone a remarkable transformation, blossoming into a completely different person.

"It is I who should be grateful, for I am relishing the joy of spending money as if it were water." Countess Trier waved away any thanks from her companion.  With eyes filled with admiration, she surveyed the work of art created by the combined efforts of Bastian Klauswitz's wealth and her own vision.

In a stunning display of chivalry, he made a personal visit to the Countess's opulent abode to deliver the news of his proposal, an evening that followed his visit to Duke Dyssen at the hospital. 

The suddenness of his decision was unexpected, but it was the announcement of the wedding date, which he had boldly finalized and relayed to her, that left her utterly astonished. Despite the barrage of shocks, it was a testament to her fortitude and divine grace that her heart did not falter, leaving her to bask in the glory of her own beauty and elegance.

Bastian had but one request for her - Make her the most exquisite and gorgeous. Without hesitation, he assured her that the cost was of no concern, and true to his word, provided an endless stream of cash, as if from a fountain of never-ending wealth. 

"When I first laid eyes on you, I had a sense deep within that perhaps I could make this marriage a reality. And now, look at us," Countess Trier's smile beamed with radiance as she wrapped her hand around Odette's, adorned with an engagement ring so stunning that even her slender finger appeared almost too delicate to support it.

The extravagance of the gift was almost too much to comprehend for an engagement that had barely lasted a month, but there was simply no reason to deny her this symbol of love and commitment. 

"It appears that your fiancé's wealth far surpasses what the world had imagined," the Countess remarked, unable to contain her surprise. "The Emperor's desire to protect his daughter has inadvertently extended to protecting his niece as well."

As the Countess released Odette's hand, she deftly unfolded her fan with a flourish, casting a mystifying aura about her. Odette continued to smile enigmatically, exuding a quiet and graceful demeanor that left the Countess in awe. It was clear that Bastian's choice in proposing to Odette was unparalleled and simply extraordinary, as the Countess was once again convinced of his impeccable taste. 

The air was electrified with anticipation as the proposal reached its climactic moment, and when he finally popped the question, it was nothing short of perfect.

Seven years had passed since the great antiquarian's departure from the world. In that time, his legacy had been silently fading away, until it was just a distant memory. The rumors and speculations had died down, and the heir, the grandson, remained quiet.

The hidden financier, who once dominated the era, had been relegated to obscurity.

But while the world had forgotten about him, Bastian Klauswitz had been quietly making a name for himself. He graduated from the military academy as planned, and had been commissioned as an officer. He was living his life with discipline and dedication, just like a true soldier.

Bastian had kept his wealth a closely guarded secret, giving only vague hints about his financial status. However, as soon as the decision to marry was made, he sprang into action. It was as though he had been waiting for this moment, biding his time until he could reveal the true extent of his riches. And in choosing Odette as his bride, he had made a shrewd move, selecting the perfect trophy to showcase his new and impressive leap into the upper echelons of society.

"Have you seen the wedding hall yet? No? Well, tomorrow we have a little time to spare. How about we go together?" Countess Trier spoke with a hint of excitement in her voice. Her mind was already racing with anticipation for the chaos that would ensue when they revealed the grandeur of the wedding venue. She couldn't resist the temptation to witness the expressions on everyone's faces as they marveled at the magnificence of the place.

“Thank you, but I believe I'll have the chance to see it soon enough. You've been working hard, Countess Trier, so please take the time to rest tomorrow." Odette's composure was unwavering as she declined the offer with a polite smile. It was as if she already knew every detail of the wedding hall and the upcoming wedding. 

Countess Trier couldn't help but wonder why Odette was so serene and composed throughout the entire wedding preparation. It was as if she had already lived a hundred years and had seen everything life had to offer. Despite her age, she carried herself with the grace and poise of an old soul.

The Countess knew that Odette was not like any other bride she had seen before, but she chose to keep quiet about it. It was clear that Odette was dealing with a lot, especially with her father's recent accident. Even though he was far from perfect, he was still her father, and the news had undoubtedly taken a toll on her.

Bastian Klauswitz resolved the Dyssen family crisis with a swift stroke of his wealth. He spared no expense in ensuring the Duke's recovery, securing him in a top-tier convalescent hospital near Ratz. It was a luxurious confinement, a gilded cage where the Duke was destined to spend his remaining days.

As for Tira, the Duke's illegitimate daughter, Bastian arranged for her to attend an elite girls' school in Carlsbar. With the wedding behind them, Tira would be swiftly sent away, effectively banishing the entire Dyssen clan from Odette's life.

A wave of regret swept over Odette as she said goodbye to her sister, but the Countess saw things differently. She viewed this as a chance for Odette to release the weights that were no longer useful to her and set off on a journey of self-exploration.

The Countess admired Bastian Klauswitz's audacity in acting without regard to reputation or appearance. Closer inspection revealed that his strategy was shrewd and uncomplicated, conveying a feeling of direction and clarity.

"Saving the good gift until the last minute is actually a good idea," Countess Trier remarked.

As they traveled, the carriage came to a halt upon a signal. To their surprise, the staff of Sabine dress shop had gathered on the main street to greet them.

Odette quickly descended from the carriage after rearranging her clothing.

The priceless gem, the grandson of the antique trader discovered was incredibly elegant and lovely today.



For a long time, Sandrine couldn't speak, her amazement leaving her gasping for air.

During a little awkward pause, Lucas said, "I'll be taking a walk in the garden for a time," to break the ice.

Lucas rose from his seat, a perplexed expression etched on his face, as he darted his gaze back and forth between the two individuals before him. 

Sandrine remained fixated solely on Bastian, leaving Lucas feeling like a mere prop brought along to lend legitimacy to his visit to the man's home on the eve of the wedding. Aware of his lack of qualification to intervene, Lucas simply stood by, a silent observer to their conversation.

Sandrine's rage had subsided, and a hint of a smile crept onto her lips as she spoke. "I suppose there is one thing I like about you," she said, her voice carrying a note of amusement. 

Bastian's attention shifted from the servants hustling about with his bags and settled on Sandrine, curious about what she might say next.

Bastian Klauswitz had arrived in person to break the news of his impending marriage. Despite the gravity of the situation, his demeanor was strikingly nonchalant. He explained that he had been offered an advantageous deal by the emperor, one that required him to enter into a sham marriage for a period of two years. 

The most ludicrous part of it all was that Sandrine's father had given his blessing to the arrangement, even after Bastian made it clear that divorce was on the horizon. The allure of benefits and titles was apparently too great to ignore, and Bastian appeared unfazed by the whole affair.

With a few deft movements of the abacus, Duke Laviere arrived at a straightforward conclusion: Bastian and Sandrine would remarry regardless, so there was no need to let this interfere with their existing business arrangement.

Sandrine was not blind to her father calculation, but she found it hard to forgive Bastian for his betrayal without first consulting her. She believed that an apology, at the very least, was in order, and so she bided her time. But Bastian, like a fool, failed to offer an apology, and now his wedding day was rapidly approaching.

"The fact of the matter is, you haven't offered me a single apology," Sandrine said pointedly, her voice laced with frustration. 

Bastian parroted his response yet again. "I've already sought your father's understanding in this matter, and the Duke has granted it," he stated plainly.

Sandrine couldn't help but laugh at the sheer audacity of his words. As she chuckled, a plaid pattern formed on her face, cast by the midday sun shining through the window after hiding behind the clouds for a time.

"For a moment, I forgot that you are just like my father," Sandrine exclaimed bitterly. "He only cares about money and his mines, not about me."

"Even with the mine aside, Countess, the diamond mine belonging to the Laviere family is one of the biggest in the world," Bastian remarked. "You should be proud of that, at least."

Bastian made jokes while maintaining a serious expression. No, she wasn't even certain it was a joke.

"You and my father truly are remarkable," Sandrine said scathingly, her words dripped with disdain as she spoke. "Living your lives by numbers, never knowing the pain of someone with a heart."

"Is there anything else you wish to say?" Bastian asked sarcastically.

Bastian rang the call bell while setting down the teacup he was holding. After giving the butler a few instructions, Bastian quickly turned to approach Sandrine again while still smiling smoothly.

"I see you're quite occupied with preparations for your move," Sandrine remarked wryly. "How does it feel to begin your newlywed life with your stunning wife in your newly-built mansion?"

With a determined look in her eyes, Sandrine held Bastian's gaze and smiled, refusing to back down. Despite the anger coursing through her body, causing her hands to feel cold and stiff with tension, she managed to maintain enough self-control to hold onto the last shred of her self-respect.

"I can't say much about newlywed life yet, since I haven't experienced it myself," Bastian replied, a hint of defensiveness creeping into his tone. "Perhaps as Countess Lenart, you know it better, since you already had your fair share of it. Wouldn't you agree?"

"Are you trying to insult me?" Sandrine retorted, her voice edged with a mix of anger and hurt.

"I'm just being honest here," Bastian said, his tone unapologetic. "Although it does seem a bit absurd for both a married woman and a man who's never been married to be interfering in my affairs, doesn't it? After all, we both have our own experiences with marriage and divorce." His words landed with a smugness that finally pushed Sandrine over the edge.

"You're putting me in an impossible situation, Bastian Klauswitz! Have you even considered who is at a disadvantage here? Or are you incapable of thinking beyond yourself?" Sandrine's voice rose in frustration, her eyes flashing with anger as she confronted Bastian. 

Bastian's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "You're the daughter of Duke Laviere, one of the most coveted brides in the realm. And yet, here we are, having this pitiful conversation. What does that say about you?"

“I beg your pardon?” Sandrine said in a confused tone.

Bastian's smile faded as he spoke with an air of calculated precision, "Your father's position and influence were crucial to me, just as my wealth was to him. Our symbiotic relationship has served us well thus far. However, if we were to enter into a marriage, we could solidify this alliance and ensure its stability for years to come. And in you, I see the woman who can offer me the most in this regard. But let me be clear, I do not consider myself at a disadvantage in any way."

Bastian leaned in and spoke with a hint of conviction in his voice, "My dear, I have a proposition for you. Once I have completed my dealings with the emperor, I plan on marrying you. Your privilege is of utmost importance to me, but if for some reason you are not comfortable with it, I am willing to reevaluate things in the next two years."

Sandrine hesitated for a moment before addressing Bastian, "Bastian, I . . . . “ her voice filled with uncertainty, 

"Our relationship is what it is, Countess. If you find it difficult to accept, then perhaps it would be best for you to seek another partner for remarriage."

Bastian's tone was firm as he spoke to her. His countenance transformed, as if he had donned a mask that he had long since removed. He rose from his seat and addressed the other person, "Perhaps it would be wise to continue this conversation once you have had time to fully consider your thoughts and are in a more rational state."

Sandrine met Bastian's gaze with a challenging expression, "And if I have no intention of complying, are you planning to throw me out?"

"Please understand, my intentions are not to disrespect you, my dearest bride-to-be. I simply believe that it would not be fitting for you to be left guarding an empty home." 

Bastian spoke softly, an apologetic tone in his voice, he gestured to a clock on the fireplace in the parlor, signaling their imminent departure. Sandrine, unable to endure the tension any longer, stood up.

"Thank you for your gracious hospitality. In return for your kindness, I promise to be the most enthusiastic guest at your wedding tomorrow, applauding louder than anyone else in your new home," Sandrine declared with a smile.

Bastian expressed his gratitude for Sandrine's kindness, but also politely explained the situation. "As much as I appreciate your offer, it will be a small, intimate wedding at our modest home, and unfortunately, we won't be able to accommodate uninvited guests."

As Sandrine watched the back of her beloved departing to marry another woman, her heart felt as though it was being ripped from her chest. The crushing weight of the reality of the situation hit her like a ton of bricks, and she burst into tears, her emotions too powerful to suppress any longer.

Bastian's footsteps continued to echo in the distance as he walked away, his gaze fixed firmly ahead. Despite the knowledge that he was breaking Sandrine's heart, he did not turn back until the very end, his resolve unshakeable. It was a moment of heart-wrenching pain for Sandrine, who could do nothing but watch helplessly as her love slipped away from her.
